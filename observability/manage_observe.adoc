[#disable-observability]
== Disable observability 

Disable the observability service to stop data collection by 

the `observability-addons` on the managed cluster from collecting and sending data collection from the  scaling the `metrics-collector` deployment to zero. When the deployment is scaled to zero, data is no longer collected from Promethus.
