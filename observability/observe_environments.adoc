You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. Learn about the architecture for the multicluster observability service in the following sections.

*Note*: The _on-demand log_ provides access for engineers to get logs for a given pod in real-time. Logs from the hub cluster are not aggregated. These logs can be accessed with the search service and other parts of the console.

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is included with the product installation, but not enabled. Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. {product-title-short} supports the following S3 compatible, stable object stores:

- Amazon S3 
+
*Note*: The object store interface in Thanos support APIs that are AWS S3 restful API compatible, or other S3 compatible object stores like Minio and Ceph.
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure storage
- {ocp-short}
+
*Important*: When you configure your object store, ensure that you meet the encryption requirements necessary when sensitive data is persisted. For a complete list of the supported object stores, see https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#object-storage[Thanos documentation].

When the service is enabled, the `observability-endpoint-operator` is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. This controller collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends it to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

When observability is enabled in a hub cluster, metrics are collected by handling the hub cluster as a managed cluster called `local-cluster`.
  
*Note*: In {product-title-short} the `metrics-collector` is only supported for {ocp} 4.x clusters. 

The observability service deploys an instance of Prometheus AlertManager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization with dashboards (static) or data exploration. {product-title-short} supports version 7.4.2 of Grafana. You can also design your Grafana dashboard. For more information, see xref:../observing_environments/design_grafana.adoc#designing-your-grafana-dashboard[Designing your Grafana dashboard].

You can customize the observability service by creating custom https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] or https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules].

For more information about enabling observability, see xref:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

[#metric-types]
== Metric types

By default, {ocp-short} sends metrics to Red Hat using the Telemetry service. The following additional metrics are available with {product-title-short} and are included with telemetry, but are _not_ displayed on the {product-title-short} _Observe environments overview_ dashboard:

- The `visual_web_terminal_sessions_total` is collected on the hub cluster.
- The `acm_managed_cluster_info` is collected on each managed cluster and sent to the hub cluster.

Learn from the {ocp-short} documentation what types of metrics are collected and sent using telemetry. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html-single/support/index#about-remote-health-monitoring[Information collected by Telemetry] for information.
