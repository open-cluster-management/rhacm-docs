[#observing-environments]
= Observing environments

You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. Learn about the architecture for the multicluster observability service in the following sections.

*Note*: The _on-demand log_ provides access for engineers to get logs for a given pod in real-time. Logs from the hub cluster are not aggregated. These logs can be accessed with the search service and other parts of the console.

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is included with the product installation, but not enabled. Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. {product-title-short} supports the following S3 compatible, stable object stores:

- Amazon S3 
+
*Note*: The object store interface in Thanos support APIs that are AWS S3 restful API compatible, or other S3 compatible object stores like Minio and Ceph.
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure storage
- {ocp-short}
+
*Important*: When you configure your object store, ensure that you meet the encryption requirements necessary when sensitive data is persisted. For a complete list of the supported object stores, see https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#object-storage[Thanos documentation].

When the service is enabled, the `observability-endpoint-operator` is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. This controller collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends it to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

When observability is enabled in a hub cluster, metrics are collected by handling the hub cluster as a managed cluster called `local-cluster`.
  
*Note*: In {product-title-short} the `metrics-collector` is only supported for {ocp} 4.x clusters. 

The observability service deploys an instance of Prometheus AlertManager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization with dashboards (static) or data exploration. {product-title-short} supports version 7.4.2 of Grafana. You can also design your Grafana dashboard. For more information, see xref:../observing_environments/design_grafana.adoc#designing-your-grafana-dashboard[Designing your Grafana dashboard].

You can customize the observability service by creating custom https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] or https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules].

For more information about enabling observability, see xref:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

[#observability-certificates]
== Observability certificates

Observability certificates are automatically renewed upon expiration. View the following list to understand the effects when certificates are automatically renewed:

* Components on your hub cluster automatically restart to retrieve the renewed certificate.
* {product-title-short} sends the renewed certificates to managed clusters.
* The `metrics-collector` restarts to mount the renewed certificates.
+
*Note:* `metrics-collector` can push metrics to the hub cluster before and after certificates are removed. For more information about refreshing certificates across your clusters, see link:../risk_compliance/certificates.adoc#refresh-a-managed-certificate[Refresh a managed certificate].

[#metric-types]
== Metric types

By default, {ocp-short} sends metrics to Red Hat using the Telemetry service. The following additional metrics are available with {product-title-short} and are included with telemetry, but are _not_ displayed on the {product-title-short} _Observe environments overview_ dashboard:

- The `visual_web_terminal_sessions_total` is collected on the hub cluster.
- The `acm_managed_cluster_info` is collected on each managed cluster and sent to the hub cluster.

Learn from the {ocp-short} documentation what types of metrics are collected and sent using telemetry. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html-single/support/index#about-remote-health-monitoring[Information collected by Telemetry] for information. 

[#observability-pod-capacity-requests]
== Observability pod capacity requests

Observability components require 2636mCPU and 11388Mi memory to install the observability service. View the following table of the pod capacity requests that is for five managed clusters with `observability-addons` enabled:

[#overview-page-observe]
== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Metric data from your managed clusters by selecting the Grafana link 
* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider.
