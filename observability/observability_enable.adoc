[#enable-observability]
= Enable observability service

Monitor the health of your managed clusters with the observability service (`multicluster-observability-operator`).

*Required access:* Cluster administrator or the `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` role.

*Prerequisites*:
 
- You must install {product-title}. See link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online] for more information.  
- You must configure an object store to create a storage solution. {product-title-short} only supports cloud providers with stable object stores, such as Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph), Google Cloud Storage, Azure storage, and OpenShift Container Storage.
+
*Important*: When you configure your object store, ensure that you meet the encryption requirements necessary when sensitive data is persisted. For a complete list of the supported object stores, see https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#object-storage[Thanos documentation]. 

[#enabling-observability]
== Enabling observability

Enable the observability service by creating a MultiClusterObservability CustomResource (CR) instance. Complete the following steps to enable the observability service: 

. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster. 
. Create a namespace for the observability service with the following command:
+
----
oc create namespace open-cluster-management-observability
----

. Generate your pull-secret. If {product-title-short} is installed in the `open-cluster-management` namespace, run the following command:
 
+
----
DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=`oc extract secret/multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret -n open-cluster-management --to=-`
----
+
If the `multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret` is not defined in the namespace, copy the `pull-secret` from the `openshift-config` namespace into the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. Run the following command:
+
----
DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=`oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=-`
oc create secret generic multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret \
    -n open-cluster-management-observability \
    --from-literal=.dockerconfigjson="$DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON" \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
Then, create the pull-secret in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace, run the following command:
+
----
oc create secret generic multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret \
    -n open-cluster-management-observability \
    --from-literal=.dockerconfigjson="$DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON" \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

. Create a secret for your object storage. Your secret must contain the credentials to your storage solution. For example, run the following command:

+
----
oc create -f thanos-object-storage.yaml -n open-cluster-management-observability
----
+
.. View the following examples of secrets for the supported object stores:
... For Amazon S3 or S3 compatible, your secret might resemble the following file:
+
----
apiVersion: v1

+
For more details, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/[Azure Storage documentation].

... For OpenShift Container Storage, your secret might resemble the following file:
+
----
type: s3
config:
  bucket: YOUR_OCS_BUCKET
  endpoint: YOUR_OCS_ENDPOINT
  insecure: true
  access_key: YOUR_OCS_ACCESS_KEY
  secret_key: YOUR_OCS_SECRET_KEY

. Create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource (mco CR) for your managed cluster by completing the following steps:
+
.. Create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource YAML file named `_multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml_`. 
+
View the following default YAML file for observability:
+
----
apiVersion: observability.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: MultiClusterObservability
metadata:
  name: observability # Your customized name of MulticlusterObservability CR
spec:
  availabilityConfig: High # Available values are High or Basic
  enableDownSampling: true # The default value is true. This is recommended as querying long-time ranges downsampled data is efficient and useful.
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  imagePullSecret: multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret
  observabilityAddonSpec: # The ObservabilityAddonSpec defines the global settings for all managed clusters which have observability add-on enabled
    enableMetrics: true # EnableMetrics indicates the observability addon push metrics to hub server
    interval: 60 # Interval for the observability addon push metrics to hub server
  retentionConfig:
    blockDuration: 2h # Block duration for TSDB block
    cleanupInterval: 5m # How often we should clean up partially uploaded blocks and blocks with deletion mark in the background when --wait has been enabled
    deleteDelay: 48h # Time before a block marked for deletion is deleted from bucket
    retentionInLocal: 4d # How long to retain raw samples on local storage
    retentionResolution1h: 30d # How long to retain samples of 1 hour in bucket
    retentionResolution5m: 14d # How long to retain samples of 5 minutes in bucket
    retentionResolutionRaw: 5d # How long to retain raw samples in bucket
  storageConfig: # Specifies the storage to be used by Observability
    alertmanagerStorageSize: 1Gi # The amount of storage applied to alertmanager stateful sets
    compactStorageSize: 4Gi # The amount of storage applied to thanos compact stateful sets
    metricObjectStorage: # Configuring access to object storage
      key: thanos.yaml
      name: thanos-object-storage
    receiveStorageSize: 4Gi # The amount of storage applied to thanos receive stateful sets
    ruleStorageSize: 1Gi # The amount of storage applied to thanos rule stateful sets
    storageClass: gp2 # Specify the storage class for stateful sets
    storeStorageSize: 1Gi # The amount of storage applied to thanos store stateful sets,
----
+
You might want to modify the value for the `retentionConfig` parameter. For more information, see https://thanos.io/v0.8/components/compact/#downsampling-resolution-and-retention[Thanos Downsampling resolution and retention]. Depending on the number of managed clusters, you might want to update the amount of storage for stateful sets, see link:../apis/observability.json.adoc#observability-api[Observability API] for more information.
+
.. To deploy on infrastructure machine sets, you must set a label for your set by updating the `_nodeSelector_` in the MultiClusterObservability YAML. Your YAML might resemble the following content:
+
----
nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: 
----
+
For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.html[Creating infrastructure machine sets].

.. Apply the observability YAML to your cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml
----
+
All the pods in `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace for Thanos, Grafana and AlertManager are created. All the managed clusters connected to the {product-title-short} hub cluster are enabled to send metrics back to the {product-title-short} Observability service.

. To validate that the observability service is enabled, launch the Grafana dashboards to make sure the data is populated. Complete the following steps:
.. Log in to the {product-title-short} console.
.. From the navigation menu, select *Observe environments* > *Overview*.
.. Click the Grafana link that is near the console header to view the metrics from your managed clusters.
+
*Note*: If you want to exclude specific managed clusters from collecting the observability data, add the following cluster label to your clusters: `vendor: OpenShift`.

[#disabling-observability-resource]
== Disabling observability

To disable the observability service, uninstall the `observability` resource. See step 1 of link:../install/#removing-a-multiclusterhub-instance-by-using-commands[Removing a MultiClusterHub instance by using commands] for the procedure.

To learn more about customizing the observability service, see xref:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability].
