[#prerequisites-observability]
== Prerequisites
 
- You must install {product-title}. See link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online] for more information.  
- You must configure an object store to create a storage solution. {product-title-short} only supports cloud providers with stable object stores, such as Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph), Google Cloud Storage, Azure storage, and Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.
+
*Important*: When you configure your object store, ensure that you meet the encryption requirements necessary when sensitive data is persisted. For a complete list of the supported object stores, see https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#object-storage[Thanos documentation].

[#enabling-observability]
== Enabling observability

Enable the observability service by creating a `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource (CR) instance. Before you enable observability, see xref:../observability/observe_environments.adoc#observability-pod-capacity-requests[Observability pod capacity requests] for more information. Complete the following steps to enable the observability service: 

. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster. 
. Create a namespace for the observability service with the following command:
+
----
oc create namespace open-cluster-management-observability
----

. Generate your pull-secret. If {product-title-short} is installed in the `open-cluster-management` namespace, run the following command:
 
+
----
DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=`oc extract secret/multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret -n open-cluster-management --to=-`
----
+
If the `multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret` is not defined in the namespace, copy the `pull-secret` from the `openshift-config` namespace into the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. Run the following command:
+
----
DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=`oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=-`
----
+
Then, create the pull-secret in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace, run the following command:
+
----
oc create secret generic multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret \
    -n open-cluster-management-observability \
    --from-literal=.dockerconfigjson="$DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON" \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

. Create a secret for your object storage for your cloud provider. Your secret must contain the credentials to your storage solution. For example, run the following command:

+
----
oc create -f thanos-object-storage.yaml -n open-cluster-management-observability
----
+
.. View the following examples of secrets for the supported object stores:
*** For {product-title-short}, your secret might resemble the following file:

[#creating-mco-cr]
=== Creating the _MultiClusterObservability_ CR

Complete the following steps to create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource (CR):

. Create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource (mco CR) for your managed cluster by completing the following steps:
+
.. Create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource YAML file named `_multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml_`. 
+
View the following default YAML file for observability:
+
----
apiVersion: observability.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: MultiClusterObservability
metadata:
  name: observability
spec:
  observabilityAddonSpec: {}
  storageConfig:
    metricObjectStorage:
      name: thanos-object-storage
      key: thanos.yaml
----
+
You might want to modify the value for the `retentionConfig` parameter in the `advanced` section. For more information, see https://thanos.io/v0.8/components/compact/#downsampling-resolution-and-retention[Thanos Downsampling resolution and retention]. Depending on the number of managed clusters, you might want to update the amount of storage for stateful sets, see link:../apis/observability.json.adoc#observability-api[Observability API] for more information.
+
.. To deploy on infrastructure machine sets, you must set a label for your set by updating the `_nodeSelector_` in the `MultiClusterObservability` YAML. Your YAML might resemble the following content:
+
----
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: 
----
+
For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.html[Creating infrastructure machine sets].

.. Apply the observability YAML to your cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml
----
+
All the pods in `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace for Thanos, Grafana and AlertManager are created. All the managed clusters connected to the {product-title-short} hub cluster are enabled to send metrics back to the {product-title-short} Observability service.

. To validate that the observability service is enabled, launch the Grafana dashboards to make sure the data is populated. Complete the following steps:
.. Log in to the {product-title-short} console.
.. From the navigation menu, select *Home* > *Overview*.
.. Click the Grafana link that is near the console header to view the metrics from your managed clusters.
+
*Note*: If you want to exclude specific managed clusters from collecting the observability data, add the following cluster label to your clusters: `observability: disabled`.

The observability service is enabled. After you enable the observability service the following functionalities are initiated:

* All the alert managers from the managed clusters are forwarded to the {product-title-short} hub cluster.
* All the managed clusters that are connected to the {product-title-short} hub cluster are enabled to send alerts back to the {product-title-short} observability service. You can configure the {product-title-short} Alertmanager to take care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing the alerts to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. You can also handle silencing and inhibition of the alerts.
+
*Note*: Alert forwarding to the {product-title-short} hub cluster feature is only supported by managed clusters with {ocp} version 4.8 or later. After you install {product-title-short} with observability enabled, alerts from {ocp-short} v4.8 and later are automatically forwarded to the hub cluster.

See xref:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#forward-alerts[Forwarding alerts] to learn more.

[#disabling-observability-resource]
== Disabling observability

To disable the observability service, uninstall the `observability` resource. See step 1 of link:../install/uninstall.adoc#removing-a-multiclusterhub-instance-by-using-commands[Removing a MultiClusterHub instance by using commands] for the procedure.

To learn more about customizing the observability service, see xref:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability].
