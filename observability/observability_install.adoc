[#enable-observability]
= Enable observability service

Monitor the health of your managed clusters with the observability service (`multicluster-observability-operator`).

*Required access:* Cluster administrator or the `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` role.

*Prerequisites*:
 
- You must install {product-title}. See link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online] for more information.  
- You must configure an object store to create a storage solution. {product-title-short} only supports cloud providers with stable object stores, such as Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph), Google Cloud Storage, and Azure storage.
+
*Important*: When you configure your object store, ensure that you meet the encryption requirements necessary when sensitive data is persisted. For a complete list of the supported object stores, see link:https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#object-storage[Thanos documentation]. 

[#enabling-observability]
== Enabling observability

Enable the observability service by creating a MultiClusterObservability CustomResource (CR) instance. Complete the following steps to enable the observability service: 

. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster. 
. Create a namespace for the observability service with the following commad:
+
----
oc create-namespace open-cluster-management-observability
----

. Copy the `multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret` from the `open-cluster-management` namespace to the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace by running the following command:

+
----
oc get secret multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret -n open-cluster-management --export -o yaml |  kubectl apply --namespace=open-cluster-management-observability -f -
----

. Create a secret for your object storage. Your secret must contain the credentials to your storage solution. For example, run the following command:

+
----
kubectl create -f thanos-object-storage.yaml
----
+
.. View the following examples of secrets for the supported object stores:
... For Amazon S3 or S3 compatible, your secret might resemble the following file:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: thanos-object-storage
type: Opaque
stringData:
  thanos.yaml: |
    type: s3
    config:
      bucket: YOUR_S3_BUCKET
      endpoint: YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT
      insecure: false
      access_key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
      secret_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY

----
... For Google, your secret might resemble the following file: 
+
----
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: YOUR_GCS_BUCKET
  service_account: YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
----
// is endpoint and container required? -Randy 
... For Azure your secret might resemble the following file:
+
----
type: AZURE
config:
  storage_account: YOUR_STORAGE_ACCT
  storage_account_key: YOUR_STORAGE_KEY
  container: YOUR_CONTAINER
  endpoint: YOUR_ENDPOINT
  max_retries: 0
----
. Create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource (mco CR) for your managed cluster by completing the following steps:
+
.. Create the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource YAML file named `multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml`. 
+
View the following default YAML file for observability:
+
----
apiVersion: observability.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiClusterObservability
metadata:
  name: observability #Your customized name of MulticlusterObservability CR
spec:
  availabilityConfig: High # Available values are High or Basic
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  imagePullSecret: multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret
  observabilityAddonSpec: # The ObservabilityAddonSpec defines the global settings for all managed clusters which have observability add-on enabled
    enableMetrics: true # EnableMetrics indicates the observability addon push metrics to hub server
    interval: 60 # Interval for the observability addon push metrics to hub server
  retentionResolution1h: 30d # How long to retain samples of 1 hour in bucket
  retentionResolution5m: 14d
  retentionResolutionRaw: 5d
  storageConfigObject: # Specifies the storage to be used by Observability
    metricObjectStorage:
      name: aws-object-storage
      key: aws.yaml
    statefulSetSize: 10Gi # The amount of storage applied to the Observability stateful sets, i.e. Amazon S3 store, Rule, compact and receiver.
    statefulSetStorageClass:gp2
----
+
For more information to optimize the `retentionResolution` or `statefulSetSize`, see link:../apis/observability.json.adoc#observability-api[Observability API].
// Joydeep to Provide info about modifying the `retentionResolution` or `statefulSetSize`
.. Apply the observability YAML to your cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml
----
+
All the pods in `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace for Thanos, Grafana and AlertManager are created. All the managed clusters connected to the {product-title-short} hub cluster are enabled to send metrics back to the {product-title-short} Observability service.

. To validate that the observabilty service is enabled, launch the Grafana dashboards to make sure the data is populated. Complete the following steps:
.. Log in to the {product-title-short} console.
.. From the navigation menu, select *Observe environments* > *Overview* page.
.. Click the Grafana link that is near the console header, to view the metrics from your managed clusters.
+
*Note*: If you want to exclude specific managed clusters from collecting the observability data, add the following cluster label to your clusters: `vendor: OpenShift`.

[#disable-observability-resource]
== Disable observability

Disable the observability service by removing the `observability` resource that you created. Complete the following steps:

. Log in to your hub cluster.
. Delete the `observability` resource with the following command:
+
----
kubectl mco observability
----
+
When you delete the resource, the pods in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace on {product-title-short} hub cluster, and the pods in `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace on all managed clusters are removed. 

*Important*: Your object storage is not affected after you remove the observability service.
