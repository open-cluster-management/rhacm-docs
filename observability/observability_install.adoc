// should we list the OCP is required? I think it is safe to assume here
Complete the following steps to enable the observability service: 

. Log in to your hub cluster from the command line interface (CLI). 
. Create a namespace for the observability service with the following commad:

  ----
  oc create namespace open-cluster-management-observability
  ---

. Generate a pull-secret for the `observability` namespace by running the following command:

  ----
  oc get secret multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret -n open-cluster-management --export -o yaml |   kubectl apply --namespace=open-cluster-management-observability -f -
  ----

. Create a secret for your object storage. You must first create object storage.
