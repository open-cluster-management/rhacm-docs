[#install-observability]
= Install observability service

Monitor the health of your managed clusters with the observability service (`multicluster-observability-operator`).  

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

*Prerequisites*:

- You must have {product-title} hub cluster installed as a managed cluster to use the observability feature. 
//what is the latest version of Grafana that is required? v6.0? 
- You must install Grafana version 6.0 or later. For more information, see https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/[Install Grafana].
- You must have data storage for the time series data. Configure your object store to create a storage solution. For example, Thanos can be used as a storage solution. Your object storage might resemble the following information:
+
----
type: s3
config:
  bucket: YOUR-BUCKET
  endpoint: S3-ENDPOINT
  insecure: true
  access_key: ACCESS_KEY
  secret_key: SECRET_KEY
----
+
For more information, see  _Object Storage_ in the https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#configuration[Thanos documentation]. 
- {ocp} must be installed. For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/architecture/architecture-installation.html[{ocp-short} installation overview].


[#enablement-for-observability]
== Enablement for observability

Enable the observability service by creating a `multicluster-observability` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). Complete the following steps to enable the observability service: 

. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster. 
. Verify that the observaility components are installed:
.. For the `multicluster-observability-operator`, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl get pods -n open-cluster-management|grep observability
----
.. For the `observability-addons` run the following command:
+
----
 kubectl get crd |grep obser
----

. Create a namespace for the observability service with the following commad:

+
----
oc create-namespace open-cluster-management-observability
----

. Generate a pull-secret for the `observability` namespace by running the following command:
//--export flag is expected to be deprecated, command might need to be updated
+
----
oc get secret multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret -n open-cluster-management --export -o yaml |   kubectl apply --namespace=open-cluster-management-observability -f -
----

. Create a secret for your object storage. Your secret must contain the credentials to your storage solution. For example, if you are using Thanos, run the following command:

+
----
kubectl create -f thanos-object-storage.yaml
----
+
Your secret might resemble the following file:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: thanos-object-storage
type: Opaque
stringData:
  thanos.yaml: |
    type: s3
    config:
      bucket: YOUR_S3_BUCKET
      endpoint: YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT
      insecure: false
      access_key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
      secret_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY

----

. Create a `MultiClusterObservability` CRD by running the following command:

+
----
kubectl create -f mco_cr.yaml
----
+
Your `MultiClusterObservability` CRD might resemble the following file:
+
----
apiVersion: observability.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiClusterObservability
metadata:
  name: observability #Your customized name of MulticlusterObservability CR
spec:
  availabilityConfig: High # Available values are High or Basic
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  imagePullSecret: multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret
  observabilityAddonSpec: # The ObservabilityAddonSpec defines the global settings for all managed clusters which have observability add-on enabled
    enableMetrics: true # EnableMetrics indicates the observability addon push metrics to hub server
    interval: 60 # Interval for the observability addon push metrics to hub server
  retentionResolution1h: 30d # How long to retain samples of 1 hour in bucket
  retentionResolution5m: 14d
  retentionResolutionRaw: 5d
  storageConfigObject: # Specifies the storage to be used by Observability
    metricObjectStorage:
      name: thanos-object-storage
      key: thanos.yaml
    statefulSetSize: 10Gi # The amount of storage applied to the Observability stateful sets, i.e. Thanos store, Rule, compact and receiver.
    statefulSetStorageClass:gp2
----

. Apply the observability YAML to your cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f multiclusterobservability_cr.yaml
----

After you install observability, all of the pods in your `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace for Thanos, Grafana, and AlertManager are automatically installed. All managed clusters that are connected to {product-title-short} can send metrics to the cluster.

== Uninstall observability

Uninstall the observability service by completing the following steps:

. Log in to your hub cluster.
. Delete the `multicluster-observability-operator` resource instance with the following command:
+
----
kubectl delete multicluster-observability-operator observability
----

When you delete the resource, the `multicluster-observability-operator` that run on {product-title-short} hub cluster, and the `multicluster-observability-addon` that run on all managed clusters are removed. 

*Important*:

- You must delete the observability service before you uninstall {product-title}.
- Your object storage is not effected after you uninstall the observability service.
