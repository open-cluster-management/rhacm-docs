[#observing-environments]
= Observing environments

You can use {product-title} to visualize and monitor metrics from your clusters and cloud providers. Install the observability service component, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. 

Observability is installed on the hub cluster during the product installation. The observability service can be installed in standard or high availability configurations. Observability is configured with AlertManager to communicate with third-party alerting systems. You can also explore your managed cluster data, such as the control plane health, optimization data, and cluster resources, from Grafana.

//you can view data from PromQL as well 
//should we mention observatoria.core.observatorium.io to be apart of installation
The observability service requires data storage for the time series data. You must configure your object store to enable the observability service. {product-title-short} supports different types of storage solutions. 

When the observability service is installed, the following CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) are included: 

* `multicluster-observability-operator`
* `multicluster-observability-addon`

By default, observability is disabled. When you import or create a cluster, observability is deployed automatically. For more information about managing observability, see link:../observability_install.adoc[Install observability service].

You can view metric data about your cluster by clicking *Observe environments* to see the following console pages: 

** _Overview_: Operation details across providers
** _Topology_: Visual data for clusters, applications, and policies

[#overview-page-observe]
== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider. You can personalize your view of the _Overview_ dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.

[#topology-page]
== Topology page
//pull in Jorge about this blurb
The _Topology_ page uses information from Weave Scope probe to display Kubernetes objects within a cluster. You can view hub cluster resources. As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels. You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes objects.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.
