= Observing environments

You can use {product-title} to visualize and monitor metrics from your clusters and cloud providers. Install the observability service component, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to scale and monitor the health of your managed clusters. 

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

Observability is installed on the hub cluster during the product installation. The observability service is configured for high availability environments. The observability service uses the `metrics-collector` pod on your managed cluster to collect data with OpenShift Prometheus, and sends it to {product-title-short}. 

Observability is configured with Prometheus AlertManager to communicate with third-party alerting systems. You can also create custom alerting rules. Explore your managed cluster data, such as the control plane health, optimization data, and cluster resources from Grafana.

The observability service requires data storage for the time series data. You must configure your object store to enable the observability service. {product-title-short} supports different types of storage solutions, such as link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/storage-services.html[Amazon S3] and link:https://thanos.io/v0.2/thanos/storage.md/[Thanos]. 

//, link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction[Google Cloud Storage], link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction[Azure storage],

When the observability service is installed, the following CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) are included `multicluster-observability-operator`, `multicluster-observability-addon`, `observatoria.core.observatorium.io`.

*Note*: When you import or create a cluster, observability is deployed automatically.

For more information about managing observability, see link:../observability/observability_install.adoc[Install observability service].

You can view metric data about your cluster by clicking *Observe environments* to see the following console pages: 

** _Overview_: Operation details across providers
** _Topology_: Visual data for clusters, applications, and policies

[#overview-page-observe]
== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider. You can personalize your view of the _Overview_ dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.

[#topology-page]
== Topology page
//Where is the info from ? 
The _Topology_ page uses information to display Kubernetes objects within a cluster. You can view hub cluster resources. As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels. You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes objects.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.
