You can use {product-title} to visualize and monitor metrics from your clusters and cloud providers. Install the observability service component, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. 

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is installed, but not enabled during the product installation. The observability service uses the `metrics-collector` pod on your managed cluster to "scrape" data from OpenShift Prometheus, and sends it to {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

Observability is configured with Prometheus AlertManager to communicate with third-party alerting systems. You can also create custom alerting rules. Explore your managed cluster data, such as the control plane health, optimization data, and cluster resources from Grafana.

The observability service requires data storage for the time series data. You must configure your object store to enable the observability service. {product-title-short} only supports cloud providers with stable object stores, such as link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/storage-services.html[Amazon S3] (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph), link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction[Google Cloud Storage], and link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction[Azure storage]. For a complete list of the supported object stores, see link:https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/[Thanos documentation]. 

*Note*: When you import or create a cluster, observability is deployed automatically.

For more information about managing observability, see link:../observability/observability_install.adoc[Install observability service].

You can also view metric data from your managed clusters by selecting the Grafana link from the following console pages: 

** _Overview_: Operation details across providers
** _Topology_: Visual data for clusters, applications, and policies

[#overview-page-observe]
== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider. You can personalize your view of the _Overview_ dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.

[#topology-page]
== Topology page
//Where is the info from ? 
The _Topology_ page uses information to display Kubernetes objects within a cluster. You can view hub cluster resources. As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels. You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes objects.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.
