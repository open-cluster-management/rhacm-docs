You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. 

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is included with the product installation, but not enabled. Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. {product-title-short} supports the following stable object stores:

- link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/storage-services.html[Amazon S3] (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph)
- link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction[Google Cloud Storage]
- link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction[Azure storage]

When the service is enabled the `metrics-collector` pod is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. The data collected from {ocp} Prometheus is then sent to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

//revise here
*Note*: In ACM 2.1 the metrics-collector is only supported for ocp 4.x. 

The observability service deploys an instance of Promethus AlertManager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization via dashboards (static) or data exploration. 

Customize the observability. You can create custom link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] or link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules]. 

For more information about enabling observability, see link:../observability/observability_install.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

[#observability-console-pages]
== Observability console pages

You can also view metric data from your managed clusters by selecting the Grafana link from the following console pages: 

** _Overview_: Operation details across providers
** _Topology_: Visual data for clusters, applications, and policies

[#overview-page-observe]
=== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider. You can personalize your view of the _Overview_ dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.

[#topology-page]
=== Topology page
 
The _Topology_ page displays related Kubernetes resources within a cluster. As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels. You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes resources.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.
