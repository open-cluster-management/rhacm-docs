//Speak about Overview of Observability and Topology

Install the observability service component, `multicluster-observability-operator` to monitor the health of your managed clusters. When the observability service is installed, the following components are installed: 

* `multicluster-observability-operator`
* `multicluster-observability-addon`

Observability is installed on the hub cluster during installation. By default, observability is disabled. When you import or create a cluster, observability is deployed automatically.
For more information, see link:../observability.adoc[Install observability service].
