= Observing environments

You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. Learn about the architecture for the multicluster observability service in the following sections.

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is included with the product installation, but not enabled. Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. {product-title-short} supports the following stable object stores:

- Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph)
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure storage

When the service is enabled the `observability-endpoint-controller` is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. This controller collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends it to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

*Note*: In {product-title-short} the `metrics-collector` is only supported for {ocp} 4.x clusters. 

The observability service deploys an instance of Prometheus AlertManager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization via dashboards (static) or data exploration. 

Observability certificates are automatically renewed upon expiration. View the following list to understand the effects when certificates are automatically renewed:

* Components on your hub cluster automatically restart to retrieve the renewed certificate.

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management sends the renewed certificates to managed clusters.

// is manifest work the multicluster-observability-operator yaml, the configured object store?

* The `metrics-collector` restarts to mount the renewed certificates.
+
*Note:* `metrics-collector` can push metrics to the hub cluster before and after certificates are removed. For more information about refreshing certificates across your clusters, see link:../security/certificates.adoc#refresh-a-certificate[Refresh a certificate].

You can customize the observability service by creating custom link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] or link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules].


For more information about enabling observability, see link:../observability/observability_install.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

[#observability-console-pages]
== Observability console pages

You can also view metric data from your managed clusters by selecting the Grafana link from the following console pages: 

** _Overview_: Operation details across providers
** _Topology_: Visual data for clusters, applications, and policies

[#overview-page-observe]
=== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider. You can personalize your view of the _Overview_ dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.

[#topology-page]
=== Topology page
 
The _Topology_ page displays related Kubernetes resources within a cluster. As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels. You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes resources.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.
