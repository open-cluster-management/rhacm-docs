= Manage security policies

Use the Risk and compliance dashboard to create, view, and manage your security policies and policy violations. You can create YAML files for your policies from the CLI and console. 

From the _Risk and compliance_ page, you can customize your Summary view by filtering the violations by categories or standards, collapse the summary to see less information, and you can search for policies. You can also filter the violation table view by policies or cluster violations.

The table of policies list the following details of a policy: _Policy name_, _Namespace_, _Remediation_, _Cluster violation_, _Standards_, _Categories_, and _Controls_. You can edit, disable, inform or remove a policy by selecting the *Actions* icon.

When you select a policy in the table list, the following tabs of information are displayed from the console:

- _Details_: Select the _Details_ tab to view Policy details, Placement details, and a table list of _Policy templates_.
- _Status_: Select the _Status_ tab to view a table list of violations. You can filter your view by _Clusters_ or _Templates_. To view the compliance status of your policy, select the _Status_ tab. Click the _View history_ link to view a list of violation messages.
- _YAML_: Select the _YAML_ tab to view, and or edit your policy with the editor. Select the YAML toggle to view or hide the editor.
