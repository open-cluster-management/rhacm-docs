[#configuring-governance-ansible]
= Configuring Ansible Tower for governance

{product-title} governance can be integrated with Ansible Tower automation to create policy violation automations. You can configure the automation from the {product-title-short} console.

[#prerequisites-grc-ansible]
== Prerequisites

* {ocp} 4.5 or later

* You must have Ansible Tower version 3.7.3 or a later version installed. It is best practice to install the latest supported version of Ansible Tower. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/[Red Hat Ansible Tower documentation] for more details.

* Install the Ansible Automation Platform Resource Operator on to your hub cluster to connect Ansible jobs to the governance framework. For best results when using the AnsibleJob to launch Ansible Tower jobs, the Ansible Tower job template should be idempotent when it is run. If you do not have Ansible Automation Platform Resource Operator, you can find it from the {ocp} _OperatorHub_ page. 

For more information about installing and configuring Ansible Tower automation, see link:../applications/ansible_config.adoc#setting-up-ansible[Setting up Ansible tasks (Technology preview)]
