[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

{product-title} supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to {ocp}. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/using-rbac.html[{ocp-short} documentation].

*Note*: Action buttons are disabled from the console if the user-role access is impermissible.

// for server foundation meeting, will managed cluster roles that are generate will automatically include the Kubernetes ns (admin and view)? is the managed cluster set in the build? will the provision role be ready for 2.3?

// generate managed cluster view per managed cluster, mcset per mcset not aggregated to admin and view role (only cluster role bindings used ) 2 clusterroles generated for both

//is a ns role required? when a user is bound to a role, cluster role bindings are created in the cluster ns (James-only using clusterset?) , it'll bind to admin and view in a specific namespace. Clusterset is a "beta feature" featured flags that would need to be enabled

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-wide and some are namespace-scoped. You must apply cluster role bindings and namespace role bindings to your users for consistent access controls. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in {product-title}:

// suggestion from James: consider replacing table with just a list since the length of the role names are long 

.Role definition table

| Role | Definition
//possibly call out if its a kubernetes role vs acm role? How can we doc this ? We can ask QE for some help with how it can be labeled. Built-in Kubernetes roles does not limit the access; everyone receives admin access in that specific ns. What are the recommended roles for ACM, add note/blurb explaining the Kube access
| *cluster-admin*
| This is an {ocp-short} default role. A user with cluster binding to the `cluster-admin` role is an {ocp-short} super user, who has all access. 

| *open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin*
| A user with cluster binding to the `cluster-manager-admin` role is a {product-title} super user, who has all access. This role allows the user to create a `ManagedCluster` resource.

//might not have provision role, but there might be self-provision where the user can create any project and objects in the project (Jian will double check and confirm), cluster-wide ability to manage clusters
//add provision cluster role
//| *open-cluster-management:cluster-provisoner*
//| A user with cluster 

//add roles for machine clusterpools, kubernetes admin and view roles (no new roles should be added tho)

//clarify why a cluster and namespace binding is needed, think that a role binding is only required
//cluster role binding and role binding (in the ns) How can the user utilize the managedcluster set role
| *open-cluster-management:admin:managed-cluster-<managed_cluster_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `managed-cluster-<managed_cluster_name>` role has administrator access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named,  `managedcluster-<managed_cluster_name>`. When a user has a managed cluster, this role is automatically created.

| *open-cluster-management:view:managed-cluster-<managed_cluster_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `managed-cluster-<managed_cluster_name>` role has view access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named,  `managedcluster-<managed_cluster_name>`.

| *open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:admin:managed-clusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `managed-clusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>` role has administrator access to `ManagedCluster` resource named `<managed_clusterset_name>`. The user also has administrator access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshit.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshit.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshit.io` resources, which has the managed cluster set labels: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `clusterset=managed-clusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>`. 

// update based on PR 2026 where Dang Peng made the change; I reviewed the PR, but 
// I am waiting on confirmation from him to merge since he has Jian listed as a 
// reviewer
//verified that role names and kind resource names are different

| *open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:view:managed-clusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `managed-clusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>` role has view access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named, `managedclusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>`. The user also has view access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshit.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshit.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshit.io` resources, which has the managed cluster set labels: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterset=managed-clusterset-<managed_clusterset_name>`. For more details on how to manage managed cluster set resources, see link:../clusters/custom_resource.adoc#managedclustersets[ManagedClusterSets].

//add a section on WHO can create clusters, show oc commands to complete the tasks presented. Similar format to the cluster lifecycle section; adding instructions onto respective page


| *open-cluster-management:subscription-admin*
| A user with the `subscription-admin` role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAML files in the subscribed Git repository. *Note*: When a non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources. For more information, see the <<application-lifecycle-RBAC,Application lifecycle RBAC>> section.

| *admin, edit, view*
| Admin, edit, and view are {ocp-short} default roles. A user with a namespace-scoped binding to these roles has access to `open-cluster-management` resources in a specific namespace, while cluster-wide binding to the same roles gives access to all of the `open-cluster-management` resources cluster-wide.
|===

*Important*:

* Any user can create projects from {ocp-short}, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace.

* If a user does not have role access to a cluster, the cluster name is not visible. The cluster name is displayed with the following symbol: `-`.

[#rbac-implementation]
== RBAC implementation

RBAC is validated at the console level and at the API level. Actions in the console can be enabled or disabled based on user access role permissions. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecycles in the product.

[#cluster-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Cluster lifecycle RBAC

View the following cluster lifecycle RBAC operations.

To create and administer all managed clusters:

* Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin
----
+
This role is a super user, which has access to all resources and actions. This role allows you to create cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resources, the namespace for the resources that manage the managed cluster, and the resources in the namespace. This role also allows access to provider connections and to bare metal assets that are used to create managed clusters.


To administer a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

* Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name>` by entering the following command:

+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding (role-binding-name) --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name>
----
+
This role allows read and write access to the cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resource. This is needed because the `managedcluster` is a cluster-scoped resource and not a namespace-scoped resource.


//this step and to 2nd role binding in view might be removed- check with server foundation, if user doesn't use clusterset, they will need to complete the steps "beta feature", might be disabled by default
//auto-generate rolebinding only when you're using a clusterset
* Create a namespace role binding to the cluster role `admin` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <cluster-name> --clusterrole=admin
----
+
This role allows read/write access to the resources in the namespace of the managed cluster.


To view a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

* Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name>` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name>
----
+
This role allows read access to the cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resource. This is needed because the `managedcluster` is a cluster-scoped resource and not a namespace-scoped resource.


* Create a namespace role binding to the cluster role `view` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <cluster-name> --clusterrole=view
----
+
This role allows read-only access to the resources in the namespace of the managed cluster.


View the following console and API RBAC tables for cluster lifecycle:
//clarify how these actions relate to our product
// which roles can access secrets (credentials and provider connections), which roles can create clusters, so that the user can create a namespace, which roles can delete and manage a cluster [provide access for other users to manage a cluster] Can you see secrets within a ns w/Kubernetes

//suggesting to explicitly call the roles out, indicate which roles can perform the previous info; what are the roles are needed to accomplish a certain functionality in the product would be more useful than listing the permissions

//provide examples of how to set a group and how to use a clusterpool and clusterset, pain point is managing new clusters, clusterpools help this pain point

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `_subscription_` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `_subscription_` namespace. You must also have access to the `_channel_` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. For more information on managing applications, see link:../applications/managing_subscriptions.adoc#creating-and-managing-subscriptions[Creating and managing subscriptions].

To perform application lifecycle tasks, users with the `admin` role must have access to the `_application_` namespace where the application is created, and to the `_managed cluster_` namespace. For example, the required access to create applications in namespace "N" is a namespace-scoped binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

To perform governance lifecycle operations, users must have access to the namespace where the policy is created, along with access to the `managedcluster` namespace where the policy is applied.

View the following examples:

* To view policies in namespace "N" the following role is required:

  ** A namespace-scoped binding to the `view` role for namespace "N".

* To create a policy in namespace "N" and apply it on `managedcluster` "X", the following roles are required:

  ** A namespace-scoped binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".
  ** A namespace-scoped binding to the `admin` role for namespace "X".
