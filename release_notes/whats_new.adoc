= What's new in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability.

* Get an overview of {product-title} from link:../about/welcome.adoc#welcome-to-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Welcome to {product-title}].

* See the link:../about/architecture.adoc#multicluster-architecture[Multicluster architecture] topic to learn more about major components of the product.

* The link:../about/quick_start.adoc#getting-started[Getting started] guide references common tasks that get you started, as well as the _Troubleshooting guide_.

[#installation]
== Installation

// 2.2 stuff needed here from Chris

[#web-console]
== Web console

* You can now define the storage settings for search persistence. Persistence is enabled by default with the `searchCustomization` custom resource. For more information, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].

[#observability]
=== Observing environments

* Certificates for observability are now automatically renewed before expiration is met. For more information, see link:../observability/observe_intro.adoc#observability-certificates[Observability certificates].

* The following additional metrics are available with {product-title-short} and are included with telemetry, but are not displayed on the {product-title-short} Observe environments overview dashboard:

  - `visual_web_terminal_sessions_total`

  - `acm_managed_cluster_info` 

* You can now add custom metrics to the observability service, which are collected from managed clusters. For more information, see link:../observability/customize_observe.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Customizing observability].

* Observability automatically restricts configuration changes for observability resources (`observability-xxx`) in managed clusters to confirm that clusters are in a desired state. This is also applied in the hub cluster. Undesirable updates are reverted. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability] to learn how to customize the observability service.

* You can now design Grafana dashboards for your cluster. For more details, see link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#designing-your-grafana-dashboard[Designing your Grafana dashboard].

* OpenShift Container Storage is now a supported storage solution for the observability service. For more information, see link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

To learn more about observability, see link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observing environments introduction].

[#cluster-management]
== Cluster management

// 2.2 stuff here from Chris

[#application-management]
== Application management

You can connect to a private repository using user and access token, which is an improvement in Git connection ability. See link:../manage_applications/configuring_git_channel.adoc#configuring-git-channel[Configuring application channel and subscription for a secure Git connection] for more information.

Argo CD is integrated now so that you can manually sync any type of supported managed cluster. Enable the Argo CD cluster collection so that you can deploy applications from Argo CD to your managed clusters. See link:../manage_applications/config_argo.adoc#configuring-argo[Configuring managed clusters for Argo CD] to learn how to enable Argo CD.

For all the application management changes and documentation, see link:../manage_applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#security-and-compliance]
== Security and compliance

* You can now install gatekeeper with the {product-title-short} gatekeeper operator policy. See link:../security/create_gatekeeper.adoc#install-gatekeeper-operator-policy[Installing gatekeeper using a gatekeeper operator policy] for more information.

* You can now install the {ocp} compliance operator with the compliance operator policy. See link:../security/compliance_operator_policy.adoc#compliance-operator-policy[Compliance operator policy] for more details.

* You can now create and apply an Essential 8 (E8) scan policy to scan master and worker nodes for compliance with the E8 profiles. For more details, see link:../security/e8_scan_policy.adoc#e8-scan-policy[E8 scan policy].

* You can now rotate internal managed certificates. For more information, see link:../security/certificates.adoc#certificates[Certificates].

See link:../security/grc_intro.adoc#governance-and-risk[Governance and risk] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
