= What's new in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management.

* Get an overview of {product-title} from link:../about/welcome.adoc#welcome-to-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Welcome to {product-title}].

* See the link:../about/architecture.adoc#multicluster-architecture[Multicluster architecture] topic to learn more about major components of the product.

* The link:../about/quick_start.adoc#getting-started[Getting started] guide references common tasks that get you started, as well as the _Troubleshooting guide_.

[#installation]
== Installation

* You can now manage your hub cluster. When you install {product-title-short}, the hub cluster is automatically imported and managed. See link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online] for more information.

[#web-console]
== Web console

* Certificates for observability are now automatically renewed before expiration is met. For more information, see link:../observability/observe_intro.adoc#observability-certificates[Observability certificates].

* You can now define the storage settings for search persistence. Persistence is enabled by default with the `searchCustomization` custom resource. For more information, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].

* You can now add custom metrics to the observability service to be collected from managed clusters. For more information, see link:../observability/manage_observe.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Customizing observability].

* Observability automatically restricts configuration changes for observability resources (`observability-xxx`) in managed clusters to confirm that clusters are in a desired state. This is also applied in the hub cluster. Undesirable updates are reverted. See link:../observability/manage_observe.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability] to learn how to customize the observability service.

[#cluster-management]
== Cluster management

* You can now create and manage clusters in a bare metal environment. See link:../manage_cluster/create_bare.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-bare-metal[Creating a cluster on bare metal] for more information.

* Additionally, you can create and manage {ocp} clusters on the VMware vSphere provider with {product-title-short}. See link:../manage_cluster/create_vm.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-vmware-vsphere[Creating a cluster on VMware vSphere] for more information.

* You can now group clusters and give user access to the group by creating ManagedClusterSet resources. For more information, see link:../manage_cluster/custom_resource.adoc#managedclustersets[ManagedClusterSets].

* You can integrate your {product-title-short} with the {cincinnati} operator to upgrade your managed clusters in a disconnected environment. See link:../manage_cluster/upgrade_cluster_discon.adoc#upgrading-disconnected-clusters[Upgrading disconnected clusters] for more information.


[#application-management]
== Application management

* {product-title} application management improved usability with console configuration for managing resources. You can now create an application with supported channels in the console, create and edit an application, configure secret settings, and more. See link:../manage_applications/app_resources.adoc#managing-application-resources[Managing application resources].

* From **Advanced configuration**, you can view choose _Subscriptions_, _Placement rules_, or _Channels_ to view your resources in a table. From the table, you can also edit these resources as YAML.

* {product-title} Ansible Tower integration is available as technology preview so that you can deploy and manage Ansible jobs from the console. You can also view the job status in the _Resource topology_. See link:../manage_applications/app_console.adoc#application-console[Application console].

* As part of application management, you can integrate Ansible Tower jobs into Git subscriptions. Automate tasks and integrate with external services, such as Slack and PagerDuty services. To learn more about working with Ansible, see link:../manage_applications/ansible_config.adoc#setting-up-ansible[Setting up Ansible Tower tasks (Technology preview)].

For all the application management changes and improved documentation, see link:../manage_applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#security-and-compliance]
== Security and compliance

* You can now install gatekeeper with the {product-title-short} gatekeeper operator policy. See link:../security/create_gatekeeper.adoc#install-gatekeeper-operator-policy[Installing gatekeeper using a gatekeeper operator policy] for more information.

* You can now install {ocp} compliance operator with the compliance operator policy. See link:../security/compliance_operator_policy.adoc#compliance-operator-policy[Compliance operator policy] for more details.

See link:../security/grc_intro.adoc#governance-and-risk[Governance and risk] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
