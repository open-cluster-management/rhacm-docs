[#installation]
== Installation

You can now install your hub cluster in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. For more information, see link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online].

[#web-console]
== Web console

You can now define the storage settings for search persistence. Persistence is enabled by default with the `searchCustomization` custom resource. For more information, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].

* {product-title-short} observability service supports 7.4.2 of Grafana. 

[#cluster-management]
== Cluster management

* You can import and manage clusters in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. You can also manage IBM Z managed clusters. See link:../clusters/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for more information.

* You can display information that is specific to a cluster by using `clusterclaims`. For more information, see link:../clusters/clusterclaims.adoc#clusterclaims[ClusterClaims].

* **Technology preview:** Submariner is integrated to provide direct networking across clusters that are managed by {product-title-short}. See link:../clusters/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner] documentation for more information.

* You can now limit permissions to create, manage, and import managed clusters to specific groups by creating and assigning a `clusterrole`. See link:../clusters/define_clusterrole.adoc#configuring-a-specific-cluster-management-role[Configuring a specific cluster management role] for more information.

* Your list of cluster image sets is automatically updated to keep your list of cluster image sets current. For more information, see link:../clusters/rel_img_conn.adoc#maintaining-a-custom-list-of-release-images-when-connected[Maintaining a custom list of release images when connected].

* Automate an AnsibleTower task to run on a cluster, or on multiple clusters by creating an AnsibleJob. See link:../clusters/ansible_job.adoc#creating-an-ansible-job-for-a-managed-cluster[Creating an AnsibleJob for a managed cluster] for more information. 

[#application-management]
== Application management

You can connect to a private repository using self-signed certificates, which is an improvement in Git connection ability. See link:../applications/configuring_git_channel.adoc#configuring-git-channel[Configuring application channel and subscription for a secure Git connection] for more information.

Argo CD is integrated now so that you can manually sync any type of supported managed cluster. Enable the Argo CD cluster collection so that you can deploy applications from Argo CD to your managed clusters. See link:../applications/config_argo.adoc#configuring-argo[Configuring managed clusters for Argo CD] to learn how to enable Argo CD.

For all the application management changes and documentation, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#risk-and-compliance]
== Risk and compliance

//updated the name of the section based on issue 11273
