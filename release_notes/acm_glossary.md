### console

### container

A system construct that allows users to simultaneously run separate logical operating system instances. Containers use layers of file systems to minimize image sizes and promote reuse. See also [image](#image), [layer](#layer), [registry](#registry).

### container image

In Docker, standalone, executable software, including code and system tools, that can be used to run an application.

### container orchestration

The process of managing the lifecycle of containers, including provisioning, deployment, and availability.

### deployable

A Kubernetes resource that contain templates that wrap other Kubernetes resources to be deployed. A deployable is also used to represent Helm charts.

### deployment

A process that retrieves the output of a build, packages the output with configuration properties, and installs the package in a pre-defined location so that it can be tested or run.

### DevOps

A software methodology that integrates application development and IT operations so that teams can deliver code faster to production and iterate continuously based on market feedback.

### Docker

An open platform that developers and system administrators can use to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

### Helm release

An instance of a Helm chart that runs in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Helm repository

A collection of charts.

### high availability (HA)

The ability of IT services to withstand all outages and continue providing processing capability according to some predefined service level. Covered outages include both planned events, such as maintenance and backups, and unplanned events, such as software failures, hardware failures, power failures, and disasters. See also [fault tolerance](#fault-tolerance).

### hybrid cloud
<!--use RH definition-->
A cloud computing environment that consists of multiple public and private resources.
<!--we should either add the term, open hybrid cloud or remove hybrid cloud and open hybrid cloud is the replacemement-->

### image

A file system and its execution parameters that are used within a container runtime to create a container. The file system consists of a series of layers, combined at runtime, that are created as the image is built by successive updates. The image does not retain state as the container executes. See also [container](#container), [layer](#layer), [registry](#registry).

### image manager

A centralized location for managing images inside a cluster.

### inception container

See [installer container](#installer-container).


### ingress

A collection of rules to allow inbound connections to the Kubernetes cluster services.

### isolation

The process of confining workload deployments to dedicated virtual and physical resources to achieve multi-tenancy support.

### isolation segment

A division that can be used to separate applications as if they were in different deployments without the need for redundant management and network complexity.

### Istio

Open technology that provides a way for developers to seamlessly connect, manage and secure networks of different microservices, regardless of platform, source, or vendor.

### microservice

A set of small, independent architectural components, each with a single purpose, that communicate over a common lightweight API.

### public cloud

A cloud computing environment in which access to standardized resources, such as infrastructure, multi-tenant hardware, and services, is available to subscribers on a pay-per-use basis. See also [private cloud](#private-cloud).
