[#search-in-the-console]
= Search in the console

For {product-title}, search provides visibility into your resources across all of your clusters. Search uses Redisgraph, an in-memory database, to store the Kubernetes resources and the resource relationships. You can create a `searchcustomization` custom resource (CR) to define the storage settings for search persistence if you want to change the storage class and storage size. 

[#search-customization]
== Search customization

When you install {product-title-short}, the product is configured to persist the data in-memory to a file system. The statefulset `search-redisgraph` deploys the Redisgraph pod, which mounts the persistent volume named `persist`. If your cluster has a defined default storage class, the search component creates a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) of 10Gi on the default storage class. If a default storage class does not exist in your cluster, search saves the index in an empty directory (`emptyDir`).

You can customize the storage settings for search by creating the `searchcustomization` CR. Search customization is namespace-scoped and located where search is installed in the hub cluster. View the following example of the search customization CR:

----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SearchCustomization
metadata:
  name: searchcustomization
  namespace: open-cluster-management
spec:
  persistence: true
  storageClass: gp2
  storageSize: 12Gi
----

Run the following command to view search customization CRD: 

----
oc get crd searchcustomizations.search.open-cluster-management.io -o yaml
----

You can disable persistence by updating the `persistence` flag to `false` in the customization CR, which turns off saving search index to the file system. A status for persistence can be retrieved from the search operator (`searchoperator`) CR. Run the following command to view search operator CR: `oc get searchoperator searchoperator -o yaml`.

Troubleshooting :
1)  Search-Aggregator Pods cannot run :
Symptom : 
   The search aggregator pods in not Ready state with the following error in the logs :
   ```
   
E0113 15:04:42.427931       1 pool.go:93] Error authenticating Redis client. Original error: ERR invalid password
W0113 15:04:42.428100       1 healthProbes.go:36] Unable to reach Redis.
E0113 15:04:44.265777       1 pool.go:93] Error authenticating Redis client. Original error: ERR invalid password
W0113 15:04:44.266003       1 healthProbes.go:36] Unable to reach Redis.
E0113 15:04:46.316869       1 pool.go:93] Error authenticating Redis client. Original error: ERR invalid password
W0113 15:04:46.317029       1 healthProbes.go:36] Unable to reach Redis.
```

Resolving the problem : This can happen if the redisgraph-user-secret is updated . Delete the search-aggregator and search-api pods to restart the pods . 

2) Search-redisgraph pod is in pending state .
  Symptom : The Search-redisgraph pod cannot run and in pending state.
  
  Resolving the problem :  Check the pod events by running `oc describe pod search-redisgraph-0` on the hub-cluster namespace .If you have created a searchcustomization CR , check if the storageclass and storagesize is valid and a pvc can be created. List the pvc by running `oc get pvc  <storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0` . Make sure this pvc can be bound to the search-redigraph-0 pod. If the problem is still not resolved , delete the statefulset search-redisgraph, the search operator will recreate the statefulset.

3) Updating storagesize in Searchcustomization CR does not take effect:
     Symptom : Updating storagesize in Searchcustomization CR does not change the PVC configuration.
     Resolving the problem : Search Customization does not honor storagesize changes after the creation of PVC. IF you need to update the storage size , update the PVC (<storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0) by running the command `oc edit pvc <storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0`.
    
  

[#queries-in-the-console]
== Queries in the console

You can type any text value in the _Search box_ and results include anything with that value from any property, such as a name or namespace. Users are unable to search for values that contain an empty space.

For more specific search results, include the property selector in your search. You can combine related values for the property, for a more precise scope of your search. For example, search for `cluster:dev red` to receive results that match the string "red" in the `dev` cluster. 

View the following steps to make queries with search:

. Click *Search* in the navigation menu.
. Type a word in the _Search box_, then Search finds your resources that contain that value.
 ** As you search for resources, you receive other resources that are related to your original search result, which help you visualize how the resources interact with other resources in the system.
 ** Search returns and lists each cluster with the resource that you search.
For resources in the _hub_ cluster, the cluster name is displayed as _local-cluster_.
 ** Your search results are grouped by `kind`, and each resource `kind` is grouped in a table.
 ** Your search options depend on your cluster objects.
You can refine your results with specific labels.
Search is case-sensitive when you query labels.
See the following examples: name, namespace, status, and other resource fields.
Auto-complete provides suggestions to refine your search.
See the following example:
  *** Search for a single field, such as `kind:pod` to find all pod resources.
  *** Search for multiple fields, such as `kind:pod namespace:default` to find the pods in the default namespace.

+
*Notes:*

** You can also search with conditions by using characters, such as `+>, >=, <, <=, !=+`.
** When you search for more than one property selector with multiple values, the search returns either of the values that were queried. View the following examples:
*** When you search for `kind:pod name:a`, any pod named `a` is returned.
*** When you search for `kind:pod name:a,b`, any pod named `a` or `b` are returned.
*** Search for `kind:pod status:!Running` to find all pod resources where the status is not `Running`.
*** Search for `kind:pod restarts:>1` to find all pods that restarted at least twice.
. If you want to save your search, click the *Save disk* icon.
