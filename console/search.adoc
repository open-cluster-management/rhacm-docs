[#search-in-the-console]
= Search in the console

For {product-title}, Search provides visibility into your resources across all your clusters.

You can type any text value in the _Search box_ and results include anything with that value from any property, such as a name or namespace. If you search for `RedHat` and you manage a large number of clusters, it might take a longer time to receive search results. 

For more specific search results, include the property selector in your search. You can combine related values for the property, for a more precise scope of your search. For example, search for `cluster:dev red` to receive results that match the string "red" in the `dev` cluster.

. Click *Search* in the navigation menu.
. Type a word in the _Search box_, then Search finds your resources that contain that value.
 ** As you search for resources, you receive other resources that are related to your original search result, which help you visualize how the resources interact with other resources in the system.
 ** Search returns and lists each cluster with the resource that you search.
For resources in the _hub_ cluster, the cluster name is displayed as _local-cluster_.
 ** Your search results are grouped by `kind`, and each resource `kind` is grouped in a table.
 ** Your search options depend on your cluster objects.
You can refine your results with specific labels.
Search is case-sensitive when you query labels.
See the following examples: name, namespace, status, and other resource fields.
Auto-complete provides suggestions to refine your search.
See the following example:
  *** Search for a single field, such as `kind:pod` to find all pod resources.
  *** Search for multiple fields, such as `kind:pod namespace:default` to find the pods in the default namespace.

+
*Notes:*
 ** Users are unable to search for values that contain an empty space.
 ** Any user can search for resources, but results are based on your role-based access control assignment.
Additionally, if you save and share a Search query with another user, returned results depend on access level for that user.
For more information on role access, see _Using RBAC Authorization_ in the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes documentation].
 ** You can also search with conditions by using characters, such as `+>, >=, <, <=, !=+`.
 ** When you search for more than property selector with multiple values, the search returns either of the values that were queried. View the following examples:
 *** When you search for `kind:pod name:a`, any pod named `a`.
 *** When you search for `kind:pod name:a,b`, any pod named `a` or `b` are returned.
+
See the following example:

  *** Search for `kind:pod status:!Running` to find all pod resources where the status is not `Running`.
  *** Search for `kind:pod restarts:>1` to find all pods that restarted at least twice.
. If you want to save your search, click the *Save disk* icon.
