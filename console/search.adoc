[#search-in-the-console]
= Search in the console

For {product-title}, Search provides visibility into your resources across all of your clusters. Search uses Redisgraph (`redisgraph-tls`), to store the Kubernetes resources and the resource relationships. Use the `searchCustomization` custom resource (CR) to define storage settings for search persistence. 

*Note:* If the `redisgraph-tls` pod crashes, data is resent from the `search-collector` pod to rebuild the cache.

[#search-customization]
== Search customization

Define the storage settings for search by updating the `searchCustomization` CR. Search customization is namespace-scoped and located where search is installed in the hub cluster. By default, `searchCustomization` CR is enabled.

Your cluster must have a default storage class defined. If your cluster has a defined default storage class, the search component creates a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) of 10G on the storage class. Verify if there is a defined storage class in your cluster by running the following command: `kubectl get storageclass`. 

If a default storage class is absent or search fails to create a PVC, a status for PVC can be retrieved from the search operator (`search-collector`) and search uses the `emptyDir` persistence volume. To prevent search from using `emptyDir`, update the `fallbackToEmptyDir` flag. For more informatu=ion, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir[Volumes] in the Kubernetes documentation. 

// do users need to run a command to access the CR?
View the following table to view status messages for the `searchCustomization` CR:

.Status table
|===
| Parameter | Status message
| statusUsingPVC | "Redisgraph is using PersistenceVolumeClaim"
| statusDegradedEmptyDir | "Degraded mode using EmptyDir. Unable to use PersistenceVolumeClaim"
| statusUsingNodeEmptyDir | "Node level persistence using EmptyDir"
| statusFailedDegraded | "Unable to create Redisgraph Deployment in Degraded Mode"
| statusFailedUsingPVC | "Unable to create Redisgraph Deployment using PVC"
| statusFailedNoPersistence | "Unable to create Redisgraph Deployment"
|===

[#queries-in-the-console]
== Queries in the console

You can type any text value in the _Search box_ and results include anything with that value from any property, such as a name or namespace. Users are unable to search for values that contain an empty space.

For more specific search results, include the property selector in your search. You can combine related values for the property, for a more precise scope of your search. For example, search for `cluster:dev red` to receive results that match the string "red" in the `dev` cluster.

. Click *Search* in the navigation menu.
. Type a word in the _Search box_, then Search finds your resources that contain that value.
 ** As you search for resources, you receive other resources that are related to your original search result, which help you visualize how the resources interact with other resources in the system.
 ** Search returns and lists each cluster with the resource that you search.
For resources in the _hub_ cluster, the cluster name is displayed as _local-cluster_.
 ** Your search results are grouped by `kind`, and each resource `kind` is grouped in a table.
 ** Your search options depend on your cluster objects.
You can refine your results with specific labels.
Search is case-sensitive when you query labels.
See the following examples: name, namespace, status, and other resource fields.
Auto-complete provides suggestions to refine your search.
See the following example:
  *** Search for a single field, such as `kind:pod` to find all pod resources.
  *** Search for multiple fields, such as `kind:pod namespace:default` to find the pods in the default namespace.

+
*Notes:*

** You can also search with conditions by using characters, such as `+>, >=, <, <=, !=+`.
** When you search for more than one property selector with multiple values, the search returns either of the values that were queried. View the following examples:
*** When you search for `kind:pod name:a`, any pod named `a` is returned.
*** When you search for `kind:pod name:a,b`, any pod named `a` or `b` are returned.
*** Search for `kind:pod status:!Running` to find all pod resources where the status is not `Running`.
*** Search for `kind:pod restarts:>1` to find all pods that restarted at least twice.
. If you want to save your search, click the *Save disk* icon.
