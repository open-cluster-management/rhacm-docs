[#welcome-page]
== Welcome page

From the {product-title} Welcome page, you get more information about the product and you can access header features, such as _Search_ and _Create resource_.
When you select _Create resource_, you can create a YAML file or JSON file for a deployment.
Also from the _Header_, you can click the *Help* (?) icon to view the _About_ page and the documentation.
From the _User_ menu, you can access the _Configure Client_ page.
Additionally, you can access the xref:../console/vwt_search.adoc#searching-with-visual-web-terminal[Visual Web Terminal] from the header.

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

Install the observability service component, `multicluster-observability-operator` to monitor the health of your managed clusters. When the observability service is installed, the following components are installed: 

* `multicluster-observability-operator`
* `multicluster-observability` CustomresourceDefinition (CRD)

Observability is installed on the hub cluster, and disabled automatically during {product-title-short} installation. 
For more information, see link:../observability.adoc[Install observability service].


[#observe-environment-details]
=== Observe environment details

You can view the following information about your clusters on the Overview dashboard:

* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many elements on the dashboard can be clicked to open a search for related resources.
Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider.
You can personalize your view of the Overview dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.


[#filtering-your-results]

Click *Show details* to view the map.
The size of the color-coordinated boxes represents the number of nodes on your cluster.
Hover your cursor over the box to view the response time of your cluster.

[#topology-page]
== Topology page

The Topology page uses information from Weave Scope probe to display Kubernetes objects within a cluster.
You can view hub cluster resources.
As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels.
You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes objects.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.

[#governance-and-risk-dashboard]
== Governance and risk dashboard

Use the Governance and risk dashboard to create and manage policies and policy controllers.
