== _metrics-collector_ fails 

The metrics collector might fail to push metrics to the {product-short} hub cluster 

[#symptom-observability-invalid-certification]
=== Symptom 1: Certification is invalid

After you import your managed cluster, you might receive the following error message due to invalid certfication for the `metrics-collector-deployment-x`: 
 
----
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
----

You might receive the error if the `observability-managed-cluster-certs` secret is deleted or recreated after the `metrics-collector-deployment-x` pod restarted. The certificates are not updated in the secret.

=== Resolving the problem: Certification is invalid

If you have this problem, complete the following steps:

. Log in to your {product-short} hub cluster. 
. Restart `multicluster-observability-operator-x` pod.
. Access the `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace and restart the `metrics-collector-deployment-x` pod on your managed cluster.

If the storage of the mounted persistent volume on the `observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x` pod reaches capacity, the metrics collector fails to send metrics to the .

You might receive the following error message in the logs of `metrics-collector-deployment-x` pod: `no space left on device`.
