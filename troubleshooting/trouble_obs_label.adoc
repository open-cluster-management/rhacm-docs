== Undesired label value in _managedcluster_ resource

When you import a managed cluster, the observability components are installed by default. If the managed cluster is not included in the placement rule, the observability components are installed. 


[#symptom-observability-undesired-label-in-managedcluster]
=== Symptom: Undesired label value in managedcluster resource

If you find that the imported cluster is not included, your managed cluster resource might resemble the following placement rule:

---
status:
  decisions:
  - clusterName: sample-managed-cluster
    clusterNamespace: sample-managed-cluster
---



 sample-managed-cluster not included in the placementrule `observability`, it is possible that managedcluster resource of that cluster has some labels with undesired value. In this managedcluster resource, if you have add a label `observability` with value `disabled`, this cluster will be filtered out by placement `observability`. Also, system will automatically add a label `vendor` for the managedcluster resource to reflect the vendor type of the cluster. Currently it is only possible to install observability in managed clusters on OpenShift, and for those clusters, their managedcluster resources will have `vendor` label with value `OpenShift`. If the `vendor` label has other value, this cluster will be filtered out by placement `observability`.


[#resolving-observability-undesired-label-in-managedcluster]
=== Resolving the problem: Undesired label value in managedcluster resource

If you have this problem, update the labels in the `managedcluster` resource. Complete the following steps:

//how does the user access the resource?

. Change the `observability` parameter to `enabled`.
. Verify that {ocp-short} is listed as a target managed cluster




















has labelwih value `disabled` in , complete the following steps:



If you have this problem the managedcluster resource does not have label "vendor" with value "OpenShift", complete the following steps:

. Make sure the  target managed cluster is OpenShift platform. If not, that's desired behavior.


















For an imported managed cluster, it will has observability components installed by default. The cluster should be included in the placementrule `observability` like below:
---
status:
  decisions:
  - clusterName: sample-managed-cluster
    clusterNamespace: sample-managed-cluster
---
If the managed cluster is not included in the placementrule, which will lead to observability not installed in this cluster.
