= Troubleshooting

Before using the Troubleshooting guide, you can run the `oc adm must-gather` command to gather details, logs, and take steps in debugging issues. 

Additionally, check your role-based access. See link:../security/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] for details.

[#must-gather]
== Must-gather

To get started, learn about the troubleshooting scenarios for users to run the `must-gather` command to debug the issues.

* *Scenario one:* Use the xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting_intro.adoc#documented-troubleshooting[Documented troubleshooting] section to see if a solution to your problem is documented. The guide is organized by the major functions of the product.

+
With this scenario, you check the guide to see if your solution is in the documentation. For instance, for trouble with creating a cluster, you might find a solution in the _Manage cluster_ section. 
+

* *Scenario two:* If your problem is not documented with steps to resolve, run the `must-gather` command and use the output to debug the issue.

* *Scenario three:* If you cannot debug the issue using your output from the `must-gather` command, then share your output with Red Hat Support.


See the following procedure to start using the `must-gather` command:

. Learn about the `must-gather` command and install the prerequisites that you need at link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/support/gathering-cluster-data.html[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform: Gathering data].

. Log in to your cluster. For the usual use-case, you should run the `must-gather` while you are logged into your _hub_ cluster. 

+
*Note:* If you want to check your managed clusters, find the `gather-managed.log` file that is located in the the `cluster-scoped-resources` directory:
+

+
----
<your-directory>/cluster-scoped-resources/gather-managed.log>
----
+

Check for managed clusters that are not set `True` for the JOINED and AVAILABLE column. You can run the `must-gather` command on those clusters that are not connected with `True` status.

. Add the {product-title} image that is used for gathering data and the directory. Run the following command, where you insert the image and the directory for the output:
+
----
oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/acm-must-gather-rhel8:v2.1.0 --dest-dir=<directory>
----
  
. Go to your specified directory to see your output, which is organized in the following levels:

 - Two peer levels: `cluster-scoped-resources` and `namespace` resources.
 - Sub-level for each: API group for the custom resource definitions for both cluster-scope and namespace-scoped resources.
 - Next level for each: YAML file sorted by `kind`.
