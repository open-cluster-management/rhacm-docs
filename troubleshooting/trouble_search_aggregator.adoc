[#symptom-2-search-redisgraph-pods]
== Symptom 2: Search redisgraph pod in Pending state

The `search-redisgraph` pod fail to run when it is in `Pending` state.


[#resolving-2-search-redisgraph-pods]
== Resolving the problem: Search redisgraph pod in Pending state

If you have this problem complete the following steps:

. Check the pod events on the hub cluster namespace with the following command:
+
----
oc describe pod search-redisgraph-0
----

. If you have created a `searchcustomization` CR, check if the storage class and storage size is valid, and check if a PVC can be created. List the PVC by running the following command:
+
----
oc get pvc  <storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0
----

. Make sure the PVC can be bound to the `search-redisgraph-0` pod. If the problem is still not resolved , delete the StatefulSet `search-redisgraph`. The search operator recreates the StatefulSet. Run the following command:
+
----
oc delete pod -n open-cluster-management search-redisgraph-0
----
