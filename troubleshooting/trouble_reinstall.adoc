= Troubleshooting reinstallation failure

When reinstalling {product-title}, the pods do not start.

[#symptom-reinstallation-failure]
== Symptom: Reinstallation failure

If your pods do not start after you install {product-title}, it is likely that Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management was previously installed, and not all of the pieces were removed before you attempted this installation. 

In this case, the pods do not start after completing the installation process. 

[#resolving-the-problem-reinstallation-failure]
== Resolving the problem: Reinstallation failure

If you have this problem, complete the following steps: 

. Run the uninstallation process to remove the current components by following the steps in link:../install/uninstall.adoc#uninstalling[Uninstalling].

. Install the Helm CLI binary version 3.2.0, or later, by following the instructions at https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm].

. Ensure that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI is configured to run `oc` commands. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the CLI] in the Red Hat OpenShift documentation for more information about how to configure the `oc` commands. 

. Copy the following script into a file:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
ACM_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
oc delete mch --all -n $ACM_NAMESPACE
helm ls --namespace $ACM_NAMESPACE | cut -f 1 | tail -n +2 | xargs -n 1 helm delete --namespace $ACM_NAMESPACE
oc delete apiservice v1.admission.cluster.open-cluster-management.io v1beta1.webhook.certmanager.k8s.io
oc delete clusterimageset --all
oc delete configmap -n $ACM_NAMESPACE cert-manager-controller cert-manager-cainjector-leader-election cert-manager-cainjector-leader-election-core
oc delete consolelink acm-console-link

oc delete oauthclient multicloudingress
oc delete rolebinding -n kube-system cert-manager-webhook-webhook-authentication-reader
oc delete scc kui-proxy-scc
oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration cert-manager-webhook

Replace `<namespace>` in the script with the name of the namespace where Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management was installed. Ensure that you specify the correct namespace, as the namespace is cleaned out and deleted. 

. Run the script to remove the artifacts from the previous installation. 

. Run the installation. See link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online].
