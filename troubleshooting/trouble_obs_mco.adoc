[#current-data-on-the-grafana-dashboard-disappears]
= Current data on the Grafana dashboard disappears

Current data from the Grafana dashboards in the {product-title-short} console disappears.

[#symptom-1-current-data-on-the-grafana-dashboard-disappears]
== Symptom 1: Current data on the Grafana dashboard disappears

Data from the {product-title-short} cluster overview dashboard is empty, however historical data is still available.


[#symptom-2-pvc-does-not-change-after-editing-statefulSetSize]
== Symptom 2: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

Additionally, on your managed clusters you might receive a message in the logs for any `_metrics-collector-deployment-x_` pods that are running in the `_open-cluster-management-addon-observability_` namespace. You might receive the following error message, along with text that references that the disk is full:

----
HTTP 500
----

[#resolving-expand-the-pvc]
== Resolving the problem: Expand the PVC size

If you have this problem, complete the following steps:

. Confirm if the disk space is full by running a query. 

.. Log in to the {ocp} console. 

.. From the navigation menu, click *Monitoring* > *Metrics*. 

.. Enter the following query in the _Expression_ window and sort the query to ascend by the _Volume_ column:
+
----
kubelet_volume_stats_available_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}/kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}
----
+
*Note:* If the value is 0, then the disk is full. If the disk is full continue with the following tasks.

. Expand the `_data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x_` PVC to update the `_storage_` parameter to a greater value than the `_statefulSetSize_` value  from the MultiClusterObservability (mco) CR. Run the following command for each `_data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x_` PVC:
+
----
kubectl get pvc data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-0 -o yaml
----
+
Your `_data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x_` PVC might resemble the following content:
+
----
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 
----
+
This might take some time to work. Your changes go into effect when the value of `_storage_` and `_status_` match. Run the previous command to check.

. Verify the fix by completing the following steps:
.. Log in to your {product-title-short} console.
.. From the navigation menu, select *Observe environments* > *Overview*.
.. Click the Grafana link that is near the console header to view the metrics from your managed clusters.
.. Check the `_metrics-collector-deployment-x_` pod logs. When the error is fixed in the logs, the following message appears: `Metrics pushed successfully`.
.. Confirm if the disk space is no longer full by running a query from your {ocp} console. Enter the following query in the _Expression_ window and sort the query to ascend by the _Volume_ column:
+
----
kubelet_volume_stats_available_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}/kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}
