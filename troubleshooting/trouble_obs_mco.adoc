= PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

When you update the `statefulSetSize` for any cluster that has the observability service enabled, the persistent volume claim (PVC) is not updated.


[#symptom-pvc-does-not-change-after-editing-statefulsetsize]
== Symptom: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

After you update the `statefulSetSize`, you might receive an alert that reads, `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp`. The `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x` PVCs might be affected.

== Resolving the problem: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

If you have this problem, update the `storage` parameter in each `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x` PVC. Complete the following steps:

. Confirm that the disk space is full by running a query. 

.. Log in to the {ocp} console. 

.. From the navigation menu, click *Monitoring* > *Metrics*. 

.. Enter the following query in the _Expression_ window and sort the query by ascending by the _Volume_ column:
+
----
kubelet_volume_stats_available_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}/kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}
----
+
*Note:* If the value is 0, then the disk is full.

. Expand the `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x` PVC to reflect the edited `statefulSetSize` in the MultiClusterObservability (mco) CR. Run the following command:
+
----
kubectl get pvc data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-0 -o yaml
----

. Update the `storage` parameter in the PVC with the same value as the `statefulSetSize`.
