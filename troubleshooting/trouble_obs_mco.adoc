[#symptom-pvc-does-not-change-after-editing-statefulsetsize]
== Symptom: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

After you update the `statefulSetSize`, you might receive an alert that reads, `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp`. The `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-*` PVCs might be affected.


[#resolving-pvc-does-not-change-after-editing-statefulsetsize]
== Resolving the problem: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

If you have this problem, update the `storage` parameter in each `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-*` PVC. Complete the following steps:

. Confirm that the disk space is full by running a query. 

.. Log in to the {ocp} console. 

.. From the navigation menu, click *Monitoring* > *Metrics*. 

.. Enter the following query in the _Expression_ window and sort the query to ascend by the _Volume_ column:
+
----
kubelet_volume_stats_available_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}/kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}
----
+
*Note:* If the value is 0, then the disk is full. If the disk is full continue with the following tasks.

. Expand the `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-*` PVC to update the `storage` parameter to a greater value than the `statefulSetSize` value  from the MultiClusterObservability (mco) CR. Run the following command for each `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-*` PVC:
+
----
kubectl get pvc data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-* -o yaml
----
+
Your `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x` PVC might resemble the following content:
+
----
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 
----
+
This might take some time to work. Your changes go into effect when the value of `storage` and `status` match. Run the previous command to check.

. Verify the fix by completing the following steps:
.. Log in to your {product-title-short} console.
.. From the navigation menu, select *Observe environments* > *Overview*.
.. Click the Grafana link that is near the console header to view the metrics from your managed clusters.
.. Check the `metrics-collector-deployment-*` pod logs. When the error is fixed in the logs, the following message appears: `Metrics pushed successfully`.
.. Confirm if the disk space is no longer full by running a query from your {ocp} console. Enter the following query in the _Expression_ window and sort the query to ascend by the _Volume_ column:
+
