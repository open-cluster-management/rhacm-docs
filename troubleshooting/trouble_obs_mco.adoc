= PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

When you update the `statefulSetSize` for any cluster that has the observability service enabled, the persistent volume claim (PVC) is not updated.


[#symptom-1-pvc-does-not-change-after-editing-statefulsetsize]
== Symptom 1: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

After you update the `statefulSetSize`, current data from the Grafana dashboards in the {product-title-short} console disappears. Data from the {product-title-short} cluster overview dashboard is empty, however historical data is still available.

[#symptom-2-pvc-does-not-change-after-editing-statefulsetsize]
== Symptom 2: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

On your managed clusters, you might receive an alert in the logs for the `metrics-collector-deployment-x`  pods that are running in the `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace. You might receive the following error message:

----
HTTP 500, failing due to disk
----

== Resolving the problem: PVC does not change after editing statefulSetSize

If you have this problem, complete the following steps:

. Confirm that the disk space is full by running a query. 

.. Log in to the {ocp} console. 

.. From the navigation menu, click *Monitoring* > *Metrics*. 

.. Enter the following query in the _Expression_ window and sort the query to ascend by the _Volume_ column:
+
----
kubelet_volume_stats_available_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}/kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes{namespace="open-cluster-management-observability"}
----
+
*Note:* If the value is 0, then the disk is full.

. Expand the `data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-x` PVC to update the `storage` parameter, so that it reflects the `statefulSetSize` from the MultiClusterObservability (mco) CR. Run the following command:
+
----
kubectl get pvc data-observability-observatorium-thanos-receive-default-0 -o yaml
----

//. Update the `storage` parameter in the PVC with the same value as the `statefulSetSize`.
. Verify the fix by completing the following steps:
.. Log in to your {product-title-short} console
After the update, data appears in the Grafana dashboards.
