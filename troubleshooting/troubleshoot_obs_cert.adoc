== Certification is invalid

Metrics collector might be failied to push metrics to hub cluster due to invalid certfication.

[#symptom-observability-invalid-certification]
=== Symptom: Certification is invalid
In logs of metrics-collector-deployment-* pod in namespace open-cluster-management-addon-observability of managed cluster, you can find error message `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`. The certificates used by managed cluster are stored in the secret `observability-managed-cluster-certs` in the cluster's namespace of hub cluster. It is possible that the secret is deleted and recreated after the managed cluster imported and metrics-collector-deployment-* pod already started. In that case, this pod will not pick up the latest certificates in the updated secret.
