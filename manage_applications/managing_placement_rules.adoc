= Creating and managing placement rules

You can create and manage placement rules to define where and how Helm charts and deployables are deployed.
Placement rules help you facilitate multi-cluster deployments of your deployables.
Samples for all resources, including placement rules, are located in the xref:../manage_applications/app_sample.adoc#application-samples[Application resource samples]documentation.

The custom resource definition (CRD) and controller for placement rules replaces the placement policies that were used for applications in previous versions of {product-title}.
Placement policies are still used for governance and risk policies.

Placement rules can be defined for subscriptions and for deployables.
Define the placement rule at the subscription level for multi-cluster deployments.
Define the placement rule for a specific deployable for single-cluster deployments or to override placement settings.
