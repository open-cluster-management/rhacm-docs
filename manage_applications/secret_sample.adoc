Secrets (`Secret`) are Kubernetes resources that you can use to store authorization and other sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.
By storing this information as secrets, you can separate the information from the application components that require the information to improve your data security.

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, see the following procedure:

.. Compose and save your application YAML file with your preferred editing tool.
.. Run the following command to apply your file to an API server. Replace `filename` with the name of your file:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
----

.. Verify that your application resource is created by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get Application
----


The definition structure for a secret can resemble the following YAML content:
