[#managing-application-resources]
= Creating and managing application resources

Create application resources to group and view the application components that make up your overall Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes multi-cluster applications.
Samples for all resources are located in the xref:../manage_applications/app_resource_samples.adoc#application-resource-samples[Application resource samples] documentation.

[#create-an-application]
== Create an application

. Compose your application definition YAML content.
To create or update an application resource, you must first compose the YAML file that defines the resource.
. Create the application within Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.
You can use the console, the Kubernetes command line interface (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API:
 ** To use the console,
  ... Open the console.
  ... From the Navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.
The *Overview* tab for all applications opens.
  ... Click *New application*.
The _Create application_ window opens.
  ... Update or replace the default YAML content within the editor to define your application.
  ... When you are finished adding and editing the YAML, click *Save* to create the application.
Your new application displays within the list of applications on the *Overview* tab.
 ** To use the Kubernetes CLI tool,
  ... Compose and save your application YAML file with your preferred editing tool.
  ... Run the following command to apply your file to an apiserver.
Replace `filename` with the name of your file:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
----

  ... Verify that your application resource is created by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get Application
----
+
Ensure that your new application is listed in the resulting output.
 ** To use REST API, use the link:../apis/application.json[application POST API].

[#matching-an-application-to-a-subscription]
== Matching an application to a subscription

To associate a subscription with an application, both the subscription and application must be in the same namespace so that the subscription can retrieve Helm charts, deployables, or other resources from a channel to deploy for an application.

Within the application resource definition, the definition must include `spec.componentKinds` settings to indicate that the application uses a subscription.
The definition must also include `spec.selector` settings to define the labels (`matchLabels`) or expressions (`matchExpressions`) to use to match the application with the subscription.

Within the subscription resource definition, the definition must include the required values to match the labels or expressions that are defined by the application.

When the subscription is associated with an application, the subscription uses the `spec.placement` settings for the subscription or deployable to deploy any subscribed charts, deployables or other Kubernetes resources for the application.

For more information about the resource definition for an application, see xref:../manage_applications/app_resources.adoc#application-resources[Creating and managing application resources].

[#update-an-application]
== Update an application

. Compose your application definition updates.
Samples for all resources are located in the xref:../manage_applications/app_sample.adoc#application-samples[Application resource samples] documentation.
. Update the application definition.
You can use the console, the Kubernetes command line interface (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API:
 ** To use the console, complete the following steps:
  ... Open the console.
  ... From the Navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.
The *Overview* tab for all applications opens.
  ... Within the list of all applications, find the row for the application that you want to update.
For that row expand the _Options_ menu and click *Edit application*.
The _Edit application_ window opens.
  ... Update the YAML content for the application.
  ... When you are finished your edits, click *Close editor*.
Your changes are saved and applied automatically.

+
You can also use the console search to find and edit an application:
  ... Click the _Search_ icon in the Header to open the _Search_ page.
  ... Within the search box, filter by `kind:application` to view all applications.
  ... Within the list of all applications, click the application that you want to update.
The _Overview_ page for that application opens.
  ... Click *Edit app*.
The _Edit application_ window opens.
  ... Update the YAML content for the application.
  ... When you are finished your edits, click *Close editor*.
Your changes are saved and applied automatically.
 ** To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, the steps are the same as for creating an application.
 ** To use REST API, use the link:../apis/application.json[application PATCH API].

[#delete-an-application]
== Delete an application

To delete an application, you can use the console, the Kubernetes command line interface (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API:

To use the console, complete the following steps:

. From the Navigation menu, click *Manage applications*. The *Overview* tab for all applications opens.
. Within the list of all applications, find the row for the application that you want to delete.
. On that row, expand the _Options_ menu and click *Delete application*. A confirmation window opens.
. Confirm the removal to delete the application.
. When the list of all applications is refreshed, the application is no longer included.

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to delete the application from a target namespace.
. Replace `name` and `namespace` with the name of your application and your target namespace:
+
----
kubectl delete Application <name> -n <namespace>
----

. Verify that your application resource is deleted by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get Application <name>
----

To use the API, see the following API link:../apis/application.json[Application API].
