[#channel-samples]
= Channel samples

View samples and YAML definitions that you can use to build your files. Channels (`channel.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) provide you with improved continuous integration and continuous delivery capabilities for creating and managing your {product-title} applications.

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, see the following procedure:

.. Compose and save your application YAML file with your preferred editing tool.
.. Run the following command to apply your file to an API server. Replace `filename` with the name of your file:
+
----
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
----

.. Verify that your application resource is created by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get Application

[#channel-yaml-structure]
== Channel YAML structure

The following YAML structures show the required fields for a channel and some of the common optional fields.
Your YAML structure needs to include some required fields and values.
Depending on your application management requirements, you might need to include other optional fields and values.
You can compose your own YAML content with any tool.

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name:
  namespace: # Each channel needs a unique namespace, except Git channel.

[#channel-yaml-table]
== Channel YAML table

|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required. Set the value to `apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required. Set the value to `Channel` to indicate that the resource is a channel.

| metadata.name
| Required. The name of the channel.

| metadata.namespace
| Required. The namespace for the channel; Each channel needs a unique namespace, except Git channel.

| spec.sourceNamespaces
| Optional. Identifies the namespace that the channel controller monitors for new or updated deployables to retrieve and promote to the channel.

| spec.type
| Required. The channel type. The supported types are: `HelmRepo`, `Git`, and `ObjectBucket` (Object storage in the console)

| spec.pathname
| Required for `HelmRepo`, `Git`, `ObjectBucket` channels. For a `HelmRepo` channel, set the value to be the URL for the Helm repository. For an `ObjectBucket` channel, set the value to be the URL for the Object storage. For a `Git` channel, set the value to be the HTTPS URL for the Git repository.

| spec.secretRef.name
| Optional. Identifies a Kubernetes Secret resource to use for authentication, such as for accessing a repository or chart.
You can use a secret for authentication with only `HelmRepo`, `ObjectBucket`, and `Git` type channels.

| spec.gates
| Optional. Defines requirements for promoting a deployable within the channel.
If no requirements are set, any deployable that is added to the channel namespace or source is promoted to the channel.
`gates` do not apply for `HelmRepo` and `Git` channel types, only for `ObjectBucket` channel types.

| spec.gates.annotations
| Optional. The annotations for the channel. Deployables must have matching annotations to be included in the channel.

| metadata.labels
| Optional. The labels for the channel.
|===

The definition structure for a channel can resemble the following YAML content:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: predev-ch
  namespace: ns-ch
  labels:
    app: nginx-app-details
spec:
  type: HelmRepo
  pathname: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
----

////
[#kubernetes-namespace-namespace-channel]
== Kubernetes namespace (Namespace) channel

To create resources correctly, add the following two labels that are required in the deployable to the subscription controller that identifies which deployable resources are added:

----
labels:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/channel: <channel name>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/channel-type: Namespace
----

Don't specify template namespace in each resource template `spec.template.metadata.namespace`. 

For the namespace type channel and subscription, all the deployable templates are deployed to the subscription namespace on managed clusters. As a result, those deployable templates that are defined outside of the subscription namespace are skipped.

The following example channel definitions abstracts a namespace as a channel that holds deployable resources.
When this YAML is applied, a namespace `ch-qa` is created for the channel that is named `qa`.
When created, this channel points to the source default namespace for identifying deployables.
The channel controller maintains the resources at the actual namespace location and ensures that the resources are kept up-to-date.

[#object-storage-bucket-object-storage-channel]
== Object storage bucket (ObjectBucket) channel

The following example channel definition abstracts an Object storage bucket as a channel:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
 name: dev
 namespace: ch-obj
spec:
 type: ObjectBucket
 pathname: [http://9.28.236.243:31311/dev] # URL is appended with the valid bucket name, which matches the channel name.
 secretRef:
   name: miniosecret
 gates:
   annotations:
     dev-ready: true
----

[#helm-repository-channel]
== Helm repository (`HelmRepo`) channel

The following example channel definition abstracts a Helm repository as a channel:

*Deprecation notice:* For {product-version}, specifying `insecureSkipVerify: "true"` in channel `ConfigMap` reference to skip Helm repo SSL certificate is deprecated, as it is displayed in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  insecureSkipVerify: "true" # deprecated
kind: ConfigMap 
metadata:
  name: insecure-skip-verify
  namespace: hub-repo
----

See the replacement in the following current sample, with `spec.insecureSkipVerify: true` that is used in the channel instead:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: hub-repo
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: Helm
  namespace: hub-repo
spec:
    pathname: [https://9.21.107.150:8443/helm-repo/charts] # URL points to a valid chart URL.
    insecureSkipVerify: true
    type: HelmRepo
----

The following channel definition shows another example of a Helm repository channel:

*Note:* For Helm, all Kubernetes resources contained within the Helm chart must have the label release. `{{ .Release.Name }}`` for the application topology to be displayed properly.


[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: predev-ch
  namespace: ns-ch
  labels:

spec:
  type: HelmRepo
  pathname: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

[#github-repository-channel]
== Git (`Git`) repository channel

The following example channel definition shows an example of a channel for the Git Repository.
In the following example, `secretRef` refers to the user identity used to access the Git repo that is specified in the `pathname`.
If you have a public repo, you do not need the `secretRef`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: hive-cluster-gitrepo
  namespace: gitops-cluster-lifecycle
spec:
  type: Git
  pathname: https://github.com/open-cluster-management/gitops-clusters.git
  secretRef:
    name: github-gitops-clusters
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-gitops-clusters
  namespace: gitops-cluster-lifecycle
data:
  user: dXNlcgo=            # Value of user and accessToken is Base 64 coded.
