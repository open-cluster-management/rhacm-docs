== Deleting channel

To delete a channel, you can use the console, the Kubernetes command line interface (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API.

To use the console, complete the following procedure:

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool:

. Run the following command to delete the channel from a target namespace.
. Replace `name` and `namespace` with the name of your channel and your target namespace:
+
----
kubectl delete Channel <name> -n <namespace>
----

. Verify that your channel is deleted by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get Channel <name>
----
