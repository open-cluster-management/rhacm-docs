# Removing a deployment

Remove a deployment that is no longer needed.
{:shortdesc}

When you remove a deployment, you also remove all underlying objects, including ReplicaSets, pods, and services.

**Required user type or access level**: Cluster administrator or team administrator

1. From the navigation menu, click **Workloads** > **Deployments**.
2. For the deployment that you want to remove, select **Action** > **Remove**. The "Remove deployment" window is displayed.
3. Click **Remove**.

The selected deployment is removed from the deployments list, and all of its underlying objects are deleted.
