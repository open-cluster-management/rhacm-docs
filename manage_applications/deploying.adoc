[#deploying-by-using-application-resources]
== Deploying by using application resources

To set up and use channels, subscriptions, and placement rules for deployments, complete the following procedure:

. If the channel to represent the object store, Kubernetes namespace, or Helm repository does not exist, create a channel.
+
Ensure that you define any labels or annotations that deployables need before they are promoted to the channel.
For more information, see xref:../manage_applications/managing_channels.adoc#creating-and-managing-channels[Creating and managing channels].

. Create your deployables.

For more information, see xref:../manage_applications/managing_deployables.adoc#creating-and-managing-deployable-resources[Creating and managing deployable resources].

. If your target cluster or clusters are not subscribed to the channel, create the subscription.
For more information, see xref:../manage_applications/managing_subscriptions.adoc#creating-and-managing-subscriptions[Creating and managing subscriptions].

. Define the placement rule for the deployables that are to be deployed from the channel.
For more information, see xref:../manage_applications/managing_placement_rules.adoc#creating-and-managing-placement-rules[Creating and managing placement rules].

A placement rule can be defined for a subscription and for deployables.
 ** Define the placement rule for a subscription to have the rule apply to multiple deployables and clusters.
 ** Define the placement rule for a deployable to prevent the rule from applyin to all deployables for the subscription, or when you want to override a subscription-level placement rule.
 ** If you are referencing a placement rule, you can also include override settings for a deployable to override some placement rule values with values specific to the deployable.
. Optional.
If you created the placement rule as a stand-alone resource, edit the definition for your subscription or deployables to reference your placement rule.
. Edit the definition for your deployables and your channel to ensure that deployables are promoted to the channel.
For more information, see the _Promoting a deployable to a channel_ section.
. Use the console to monitor the status of the deployment to the target cluster or clusters for the channel.

[#promoting-a-deployable-to-a-channel]
== Promoting a deployable to a channel

To promote a deployable, which is a _resource template_, to a channel, you can use any of the following methods:

* Point the deployable to a specific channel by configuring the `spec.channels` field within the deployable definition with the correct annotations to identify the channel.
+
The `spec.channels` parameter is available for deployable (`deployable.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) resources to identify the channels where the deployable is to be promoted.
The following example shows a deployable that defines the channels where the deployable is to be included:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: Deployable
  metadata:
    name: deployable1
    namespace: default
    spec:
      template:
      placement:
      overrides:
      dependencies:
      channels:
      - mychannel
      - otherchannel
----

* Update the channel definition to identify the deployables to include in the channel.
Use the `spec.package` and `spec.packageFilter` fields to specify the deployables.
+
As an example, the following channel automatically pulls the most recent, or latest, `nginx` chart when a new chart is published to the source Helm repository for the channel.
The chart deployable must have a matching version `1.x` to be promoted to the channel.
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: Channel
  metadata:
    name: predev-ch
    namespace: ns-ch
    labels:
      app: nginx-app-details
  spec:
    type: HelmRepo
    pathname: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
  ---
  apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: Subscription
  metadata:
    name: nginx
    namespace: ns-sub-1
    labels:
      app: nginx-app-details
  spec:
    channel: ns-ch/predev-ch
    name: nginx-ingress
    packageFilter:
      version: "1.36.x"
    placement:
      placementRef:
        kind: PlacementRule
        name: towhichcluster
----

* Update the subscription definition to identify the deployables.
The configuration for promoting a deployable to a channel can also be specified within the subscription definition.

The following example subscription indicates that the most recent `nginx` version `1.x` chart is to be promoted through the channel for deployment with the subscription.

 ```yaml
 apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
 kind: Subscription
 metadata:
    name: mydevsub
    namespace: myspace
 spec:
  source: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
  package: nginx
  packageFilter:
    version: 1.x
  placement:
    clusters:
    - name: mydevcluster1
 ```

* Update the channel definition to specify channel gate requirements, and update the definitions for your deployables to include the fields and values to match the gate requirements.
+
Channel gate requirements are defined within the `spec.gate` section of a channel definition.
If the deployable has the fields to match the channel `spec.gate` values, the deployable is promoted to the channel.
In this case, the deployable does not need to point to a specific channel with the `spec.channels` field.
+
In the previous example, `packageFilter.version: "1.36.x"` indicates the specific `nginx` version `1.36.x` chart is promoted through the channel for deployment with the subscription.

[#deploying-with-a-percentage-roll-out]
=== Deploying with a percentage roll out

If you want to roll out a deployment to your target managed clusters instead of deploying to all target clusters, you can configure the deployment of a deployable or chart to only a percentage of your managed clusters at a time.

For instance, you might want to roll out a deployment when you need to deploy an update but you do not want to affect all clusters at once.
When the deployment is successful on a cluster, the deployment is rolled out to another cluster.

For more information, see xref:../manage_applications/managing_deployables.adoc#creating-and-managing-deployable-resources[Managing deployables with a rolling update].
