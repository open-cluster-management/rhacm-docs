# {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} Certificate Manager role-based access control (RBAC) support

In {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.version}} and above, RBAC support exists for {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} Certificate Manager resources. For more information, see [RBAC for Certificate Manager resources](../user_management/assign_role.md#cm). All existing RBAC rules for other resources within {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} apply in addition to the Certificate Manager rules.

The ability to access Certificate Manager resources differs from the open source version of cert-manager.

Learn what each of the following roles can do with Certificate Manager:

* [Cluster Administrator role](#clusteradmin)
* [Administrator role](#admin)
* [Operator role](#operator)
* [Other roles](#other)

## Cluster Administrator role
{: #clusteradmin}

Cluster Administrators within {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} can create, read/get/list, update, and delete all Certificate Manager resources (Certificates, Issuers, ClusterIssuers) within any namespace.

The implications include the ability to:
* Create Certificates that are signed by a ClusterIssuer
* Install or delete Helm charts that contain Certificate Manager resources


## Administrator role
{: #admin}

Administrators within {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} can create, read/get/list, update, and delete only the Certificates and Issuers within the namespaces they are Administrators in.

* The ability to deploy Helm charts:
    * Containing Certificates signed only by Issuers
    * Containing Issuers
    * Not containing ClusterIssuers
    * Not containing Certificates signed by a ClusterIssuer
* The ability to delete Helm charts:
    * Containing Certificates that are signed by both Issuers and ClusterIssuers
    * Containing Issuers
    * Containing ClusterIssuers, but the ClusterIssuers are not removed with the rest of the resources in the Helm chart when the release is deleted


## Operator role
{: #operator}

Operators within {{site.data.keyword.icp_notm}} can create, read/get/list, and update only the Certificates and Issuers within the namespaces they are Operators in.

For the namespaces that the user is an `Operator` in, the implications include:
* Operators cannot create Certificates that are signed by any ClusterIssuer
* The ability to deploy Helm charts:
    * Containing Certificates signed only by Issuers
    * Containing Issuers
    * Not containing ClusterIssuers
    * Not containing Certificates signed by a ClusterIssuer

All other roles, including but not limited to editors, viewers, and auditors, cannot create, read/get/list, update, or delete any Certificate Manager resources (Certificates, Issuers, and ClusterIssuers) within any namespace.
