[#managing-apps-with-helm-cluster-repositories]
= Managing apps with Helm repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources from Helm repositories in the following procedure. Learn more about the application model at xref:../manage_applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. Learn about access requirements from the link:../security/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation.


1. From the console navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.

2. Click *Create application*.

+
For the following steps, you can view the YAML in the console as you create your application. See YAML samples later in the topic.

3. Enter the following values in the correct fields:
 +
 * Name: Enter a valid Kubernetes name for the application.
 * Namespace: Select a namespace from the list. You can also create a namespace by using a valid Kubernetes name if you are assigned the correct access role.

4. Choose *Helm* from the list of repositories that you can use.

5. Enter the required URL path or select an existing path.

+
If you select an existing Helm repository path, you do not need to specify connection information if this is a private repository. The connection information is pre-set and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Helm repository path, you can optionally enter Helm connection information if this is a private Helm repository.

6. Enter values for the following optional fields.
 
7. Set any optional pre and post-deployment tasks.

+
Set the Ansible Tower secret if you have Ansible Tower jobs that you want to run before or after the subscription deploys the application resources. The Ansible Tower tasks that define Ansible jobs must be placed within pre-hook and post-hook folders in this repository.

+
You can select an Ansible Tower secret from drop-down menu if a secret was created in the application namespace. In this instace, the connection information is pre-set, and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Ansible Tower secret name to create a new secret, you need to enter the Ansible Tower host and token.
 

8. To block or activate changes to your deployment during a specific time window, choose an option for _Deployment window_ and your _Time window configuration_.

9. You can either choose another repository or Click *Save*.

10. You are redirected to the _Overiew_ page where you can view the details and topology.

== Sample YAML

The following example channel definition abstracts a Helm repository as a channel:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: hub-repo
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: helm
  namespace: hub-repo
spec:
    pathname: [https://9.21.107.150:8443/helm-repo/charts] # URL points to a valid chart URL.
    configRef:
      name: insecure-skip-verify
    type: HelmRepo
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  insecureSkipVerify: "true"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: insecure-skip-verify
  namespace: hub-repo
----

The following channel definition shows another example of a Helm repository channel:

[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: predev-ch
  namespace: ns-ch
  labels:
    app: nginx-app-details
spec:
  type: HelmRepo
  pathname: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
