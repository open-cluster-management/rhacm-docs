[#subscribing-git-resources]
== Subscribing Git resources 

You can subscribe Git resources to multiple namespaces. By default, when you subscribe to an application, the application is deployed into that subscription namespace. To apply these resources to namespaces outside of that subscription namespace, see the following procedure:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator 

. From the console, log in to your hub cluster.

. Create one or more users. 

+
These users represent administrators for the `app.open-cluster-management.io/subscription` application. With {ocp-short}, you can group these users to represent a subscription administrative group, which is demonstrated later in this topic.

. From the terminal, log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster again.

. Add the following subjects into `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding with the following command:
+
----
oc edit clusterrolebinding open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----
+
*Note:* `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding has no subject initially.
+
Your subjects might display as the following example:
+
----
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: example-name
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: example-group-name
----

To verify, see an example where you are logged in as a subscription administrator. In the example, you subscribe the sample resource YAML file from a Git repository, follow the previous procedure, then see updated Configmap settings. The example file contains subscriptions that are located within the following different namespaces:

* Configmap `test-configmap-1` gets created in `multins` namespace. 

* Configmap `test-configmap-2` gets created in `default` namespace.

* Configmap `test-configmap-3` gets created in the `subscription` namespace.
