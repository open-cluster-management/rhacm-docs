= Creating and managing subscriptions

You can create and manage subscriptions to identify, retrieve, and deploy new and updated resources to managed clusters.
By using subscriptions, you can improve the continuous delivery capabilities of your application management.
Samples for all resources, including subscriptions, are located in the xref:../manage_applications/app_resource_samples.adoc#application-resource-samples[Application resource samples] documentation.

Subscriptions (`subscription.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) are Kubernetes resources that serve as sets of definitions for identifying Kubernetes resources (in Git, Objectstores, or hub cluster deployables), and Helm charts within channels by using annotations, labels, and versions.

Subscription resources can point to a channel for identifying new and updated Helm charts or Kubernetes resources for deployment.
The subscription operator then watches the channel for new and updated charts and deployables.

When a new or updated Helm chart or Kubernetes resource is detected, the subscription operator downloads the Helm release version for the specified Helm chart version or the specified Kubernetes resource.
The subscription operator can download these objects directly, or as deployables, from the storage location to target managed clusters without checking the hub cluster first.

Subscriptions can filter the deployables that are promoted to a channel to select specific deployables.
For instance, the subscription can filter the deployables to select a specific deployable version.
For this case, the subscription operator checks the `version` parameter to identify the deployable version to select.
