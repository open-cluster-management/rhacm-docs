[#create-a-placement-rule]
= Create a placement rule

Placement rules can be defined for subscriptions and for deployables.
Define the placement rule at the subscription level for multi-cluster deployments.
Define the placement rule for a specific deployable for single-cluster deployments or to override placement settings.

*Prerequisite:* Be sure the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` pod is running.
You can run `oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon` to check for pods.

. Compose the definition YAML content for your placement rule.
Samples for all resources, including placement rules, are located in the xref:../manage_applications/app_sample.adoc#application-samples[Application resource samples]documentation.
. Create the placement rule within {product-title}.
You can define a placement rule as a separate resource, or define the rule within the definition for a deployable or subscription.

As a best practice, define placement rules as a separate resource when the rule might need to be referenced by multiple resources.

To create a placement rule as a separate resource, you can use the console, the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API:

 ** To use the console:
  ... Open the console.
  ... From the Navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.
The *Overview* tab for all applications opens.
  ... Click the *Resources* tab.
  ... Scroll to the _Resource pipeline_ section.
From the list of buttons, find and click *Placement Rule*.
The _Create a placement rule_ editor is displayed.
  ... Enter the YAML content to define your placement rule or directly update the default YAML template to meet your requirements.
  ... When you are finished adding or editing the YAML, click *Save* to create the placement rule.
  ... From the list of resource summary cards, click the _PLACEMENT RULES_ card.
The _Search_ dashboard is displayed and lists all placement rules that are used by the applications that are selected on the _Applications_ dashboard.
Your new placement rule does not display in this list until the rule is referenced by a subscription that is used by an application.
To verify that your new placement rule is created, enter `kind:placementrule` in the search box and run your search.
Ensure that your new rule is displayed in the search results list.
 ** To use the Kubernetes CLI tool:
  ... Run the following command to apply your file to an apiserver.
Replace `filename` with the name of your file:
+
----
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
----

  ... Verify that your placement rule is created, by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get PlacementRule
----
+
Ensure that your new placement rule is listed in the resulting output.
 ** To use REST API, you need to use the link:../apis/placementrules.json[placement rule POST API].
