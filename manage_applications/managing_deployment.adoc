= Managing deployments with channels

You can use channels and subscriptions to manage the continuous delivery of deployables, such as Helm charts and Kubernetes deployable objects, to your managed clusters or other namespaces.

When a channel points to a Helm repository, the channel operator creates a deployable to represent each Helm release that is found in the repository.

For Kubernetes deployable objects, you can add the objects to a channel by wrapping them as deployables.

Within the deployable definition you can directly specify a channel where the deployable is to be promoted.
You can also specify the required Kubernetes labels for the deployable to match the gate requirements for a channel to have the deployable automatically added to a channel.
When the channel controller detects that the deployable includes the required Kubernetes labels, the controller promotes the deployable to the channel.

When creating a `Namespace` and `ObjectBucket` channel, you can set the channel gate requirements within the `spec.gates` section of the channel definition.
These requirements are Kubernetes annotations that a deployable must include before the deployable can be promoted to the channel.
For instance, you can specify annotations for development approvals, test and quality assurance approval, and to indicate a deployable is ready for deployment to a production environment cluster.
These gate requirements can be any field and value, such as the source namespace, package name, labels, and annotations.
A deployable can be promoted in a channel only when the deployable definition includes the matching fields and values.
When a deployable meets the defined requirements, the deployable is automatically promoted to the channel and deployed to any managed clusters that subscribe to the channel.
Gate requirements do not apply for `HelmRepo` and `Git` channel types.

For channels that do not include gate requirements, the channel controller promotes the latest version of a deployable to the channel.

Clusters can subscribe to channels for identifying the deployables to deploy to each cluster.
Deployables that are promoted to a channel can be accessed by only the subscriptions for that channel.
When channels and subscriptions exist, the channels and subscriptions work together to retrieve deployables from the channel source and place the deployables at the destination.
The destination is typically a managed cluster, which is abstracted as a namespace.
A managed cluster or namespace can subscribe to multiple channels for identifying the deployables to deploy to the cluster.
Channels ensure that the correct deployable is available for retrieval.
Subscriptions ensure that the deployable is retrieved and placed on the destination namespaces or clusters.
For retrieving a deployable, the subscription operator checks the annotation limits and determines whether to retrieve and apply the deployable to the managed cluster.
