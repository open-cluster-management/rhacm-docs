[#managing-apps-with-git-repositories]
= Managing apps with Git repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources from Git repositories in the following procedure. Learn more about the application model at xref:../manage_applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. You can only perform actions that your role is assigned. Learn about access requirements from the link:../security/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation. 

. From the console navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.

. Click *Create application*.

+
For the following steps, select *YAML: On* to view the YAML in the console as you create your application. See YAML samples later in the topic.

. Enter the following values in the correct fields:

+
* Name: Enter a valid Kubernetes name for the application.
* Namespace: Select a namespace from the list. You can also create a namespace by using a valid Kubernetes name if you are assigned the correct access role.

. Choose *Git* from the list of repositories that you can use.

. Enter the required URL path or select an existing path.

+
If you select an existing Git repository path, you do not need to specify connection information if this is a private repository. The connection information is pre-set and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Git repository path, you can optionally enter Git connection information if this is a private Git repository.

. Enter values for the optional fields, such as branch and folder.
 
. Set any optional pre and post-deployment tasks. 

+
*Technology preview:* Set the Ansible Tower secret if you have Ansible Tower jobs that you want to run before or after the subscription deploys the application resources. The Ansible Tower tasks that define Ansible jobs must be placed within prehook and posthook folders in this repository.

+
You can select an Ansible Tower secret from drop-down menu if a secret was created in the application namespace. In this instance, the connection information is pre-set, and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Ansible Tower secret name to create a new secret, you need to enter the Ansible Tower host and token.

. From _Select clusters to deploy_, you can update the placement rule information for your application. Choose from the following:

+
- Deploy on local cluster

- Deploy to all online clusters and local cluster

- Deploy application resources only on clusters matching specified labels

- You have the option to _Select existing placement configuration_ if you create an application in an existing namespace with placement rules already defined.
 
. From _Settings_, you can specify application behavior. To block or activate changes to your deployment during a specific time window, choose an option for _Deployment window_ and your _Time window configuration_.

. You can either choose another repository or Click *Save*.

. You are redirected to the _Overview_ page where you can view the details and topology.

[#sample-yaml-git]
== Sample YAML

The following example channel definition shows an example of a channel for the Git Repository. In the following example, `secretRef` refers to the user identity used to access the Git repo that is specified in the `pathname`. If you have a public repo, you do not need the `secretRef`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: hive-cluster-gitrepo
  namespace: gitops-cluster-lifecycle
spec:
  type: Git
  pathname: https://github.com/open-cluster-management/gitops-clusters.git
  secretRef:
    name: github-gitops-clusters
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-gitops-clusters
  namespace: gitops-cluster-lifecycle

[#application-git-ops]
== Application Git Ops

Using a `local-cluster` placement rule, you can use a subscription to deliver configuration-related resources to the hub cluster.  

These resources can be the subscriptions that configure applications and policies, run Ansible jobs, and configure your clusters after you provision, or after you import.

[#sample-repo-git-ops]
=== Sample Repo for GitOps

In the following example repository, you see a folder for each hub cluster. You can also create a repository for each hub cluster, or a branch for each hub cluster. 

A single subscription that is defined on the hub cluster pulls in all the other configuration resources, such as hub cluster config, policies, and common applications that will configure and deploy to the hub and managed clusters.

A Git repository to store this type of information can resemble the following sample file and directory structure. See the sections for root path, managed cluster, and hub cluster:

[#git-ops-root-path]
=== GitOps root path

These files in the root path of the repository create a subscription that references this Git repository, and applies all the YAML, except what is specified in the `.kubernetesignore`. It includes these four subscription files and the `./managed-cluster-common` directory.

----
 /   # Repository root directory

  # The subscription that delivers all the previous content to the hub cluster:
  
  hub-application.yaml   # This represents the hub cluster configuration in the console
  hub-channels.yaml      # This points to `rhacm-hub-cluster` Git repository
  hub-subscriptions.yaml # This defines the time window, branch to be used, and defines which directories containing appropriate configs, such as `hub-policies`, should be used (can be all)
  hub-placement.yaml     # Points back to the `local-cluster` (hub cluster that is managed)
  .kubernetesignore      # Tells the subscription to ignore hub-application.yaml, hub-channels.yaml, hub-subscription.yaml & hub-placement.yaml
----

[#git-ops-managed-clusters]
=== GitOps application to managed clusters

The following directories contain subscriptions that will apply applications to the _managed_ clusters. These subscriptions are applied to the hub cluster through the subscription in the root directory. 

In the following sample, you see one subscription that is subscribing another:

----
common-managed/
    apps/
      app-name-0/
        application.yaml
        subscription.yaml
        channel.yaml        # This points to a repository named `app-name-0`, of type Git, Helm, or Object Storage
        placementrule.yaml
      app-name-1/
        application.yaml
        subscription.yaml
        channel.yaml        # This points to a repository named `app-name-0`, of type Git, Helm, or Object Storage
        placementrule.yaml
    config/
      application.yaml      # named: `day2-config`
      subscription.yaml     # Points to the `managed-cluster-common/config` parent directory
      channel.yaml          # Can point to this Git repository or a different repository with the day-two configuration
      placementrule.yaml    # Defines the clusters to target
managed-cluster-common/
  configs/                  # These configurations are referenced through the `config` subscription
    certmanagement.yaml
    auth-oidc.yaml
    autoscaler.yaml
    descheduler.yaml
----

[#git-ops-hub-clusters]
=== GitOps application to hub clusters

The following policies are applied to the hub cluster and offer both configuration for the hub cluster, as well as policies for remote clusters. 

These are delivered through the root subscription, as seen in the following sample:
----
managed-cluster-common/
  policies/
    policy-0.yaml
    policy-1.yaml
  hub-policies/
    policy-0.yaml
    vault.yaml
    operators.yaml
----

[#apply-gitops]
=== Apply GitOps

With the previous sample combination, you can specify the following:

. A root subscription that can be applied with a CLI command. The root subscription will subscribe back to this repository to apply all the YAML to the hub cluster.
. The subscription from step 1, which applies application and configuration subscriptions from `common-managed/`.
. The configuration subscription in step 2, which applies the resources defined in `managed-cluster-common/`.
. The policies that are defined in `managed-cluster-common/` are also applied to the hub cluster by the subscription in step 1. These policies include those targeted toward the hub cluster, as well as those that target managed clusters.
