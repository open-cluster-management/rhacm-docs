= Upgrading your cluster

After you create {ocp} clusters that you want to manage with {product-title}, you can use the {product-title} console to upgrade those clusters to the latest minor version that is available in the version channel that the managed cluster uses.

In a connected environment, the updates are automatically identified with notifications provided for each cluster that requires an upgrade in the {product-title-short} console.

The process for upgrading your clusters in a disconnected environment requires some additional steps to configure and mirror the required release images. It uses the operator for {cincinnati} to identify the upgrades. If you are in a disconnected environment, see xref:upgrade_cluster_discon.adoc#upgrading-disconnected-clusters[Upgrading disconnected clusters] for the required steps. 

*Note:* To upgrade to a major version, you must verify that you meet all of the prerequisites for upgrading to that version.
You must update the version channel on the managed cluster before you can upgrade the cluster with the console.
After you update the version channel on the managed cluster, the {product-title} console displays the latest versions that are available for the upgrade.

*Important:* You cannot upgrade Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service clusters with the {product-title} console.

This method of upgrading only works for {ocp} clusters that are in a _Ready_ state.

To upgrade your cluster in a connected environment, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
If an upgrade is available, it is shown in the _Distribution version_ column.
. Select the clusters that you want to upgrade.
*Remember:* A cluster must be in _Ready_ state, and must be a {ocp} cluster to be upgraded with the console.
. Select *Upgrade*.
. Select the new version of each cluster.
. Select *Upgrade*.

If your cluster upgrade fails, the Operator generally retries the upgrade a few times, stops, and reports the status of the failing component. In some cases, the upgrade process  continues to cycle through attempts to complete the process. Rolling your cluster back to a previous version following a failed upgrade is not supported. Contact Red Hat support for assistance if your cluster upgrade fails.
