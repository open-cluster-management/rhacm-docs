= Maintaining a custom list of release images while disconnected

In some cases, you need to maintain a custom list of release images when the hub cluster has no Internet connection.
You can create your own custom list of release images that are available when creating a cluster.
Complete the following steps to manage your available release images while disconnected:

. While you are on a connected system, navigate to the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/acm-hive-openshift-releases[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository].
. Copy the `clusterImageSets` directory to a system that can access the disconnected {product-title} hub cluster.
. Add the `yaml` files for the images that you want available when you create a cluster by using the {product-title} console by manually adding the `clusterImageSet` YAMLs.
. Create `clusterImageSets` command:
+
----
oc create -f <clusterImageSet_FILE>
----
+
After running this command for each resource you want to add, the list of available release images will be available.

. Alternately you can paste the image url directly in the the create cluster console in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management.
This will create new clusterImageSets if they do not exist.
. View the list of currently available release images in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management console when you are creating a cluster.
