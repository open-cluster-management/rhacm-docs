[#importing-an-existing-cluster-with-the-console]
= Importing an existing cluster with the console

After you install {product-title}, you are ready to import a cluster to manage.
You can import from both the console and the CLI.
Follow this procedure to import from the console.
You need your terminal for authentication during this procedure.

* <<importing-a-cluster,Importing a cluster>>
* <<removing-an-imported-cluster,Removing a cluster>>

[#gui_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* You need a {product-title} hub cluster that is deployed.
If you are importing bare metal clusters, you must have the hub cluster installed on {ocp} version 4.4, or later.
* You need a cluster that you want to manage and Internet connectivity.
* Install `kubectl`.
To install `kubectl`, see _Install and Set Up kubectl_ in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-macos[Kubernetes documentation].

// Optionally, the Visual Web Terminal supports both `kubectl` and `oc` commands and can target alternative `contexts` to work with remote clusters. (wait for testing, elder sending RFE, see Brandi or elder for history here)

* You need the `base64` command line tool.

*Required user type or access level*: Cluster administrator

[#importing-a-cluster]
== Importing a cluster

You can import existing clusters from the {product-title} console for each of the available cloud providers.

NOTE: A hub cluster cannot manage _any_ other hub cluster;
you must import an existing cluster.

. From the navigation menu, hover over *Automate infrastructure* and click *Clusters*.
. Click *Add cluster*.
. Click *Import an existing cluster*.
. Provide a cluster name.
By default, the namespace is set to the same value as your cluster name.
*Best practice:* Leave the namespace value and do not edit.
. *Optional:* Click to expand *Edit cluster import YAML file* and modify the endpoint configuration.
+
See <<yaml-parameters-and-descriptions,Table 1.
YAML file parameters and descriptions>> for details about each parameter.

. *Optional*: After you import, you can add labels by clicking *Configure advanced parameters* and use these labels to search.
. *Optional*: Configure the `MANAGED CLUSTER URLS`. By configuring the `MANAGED CLUSTER URLS`, the URLs display in the table when you run the `oc get managedcluster` command.
.. If it is not already on, turn on the `YAML` content using the switch in the web console so you can view the content.
.. Add the `manageClusterClientConfigs` section to the `ManagedCluster` spec in the `import.yaml` file, as shown in the following example:
+ 
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  labels:
    cloud: auto-detect
	vendor: auto-detect
	name: cluster-test
  name: cluster-test
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  managedClusterClientConfigs:
  - url: https://multicloud-console.apps.new-managed.dev.redhat.com
---
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
...
----
+
Replace the URL value is the external access URL address of the managed cluster. 
. Click *Generate Command* to retrieve the command to deploy the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon`.
. From the _Import an existing cluster_ window, hover and click the *Copy command* icon to copy the import command and the token that you are provided.
You must click the *Copy* icon to receive the accurate copy.
*Important:* The command contains pull secret information that is copied to each of the imported clusters.
Anyone who can access the imported clusters can also view the pull secret information.
Consider creating a secondary pull secret at https://cloud.redhat.com/ or by creating a service account so your personal credentials are not compromised.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html[Using image pull secrets] or https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/authentication/understanding-and-creating-service-accounts.html[Understanding and creating service accounts] for more information.
. From your terminal, authenticate to your managed cluster.
Configure your `kubectl` for your targeted managed cluster.
+
See xref:../manage_cluster/supported_clouds.adoc#supported-clouds[Supported clouds] to learn how to configure your `kubectl`.

. To deploy the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` to the managed cluster, run the command that you generated and copied from _step 8_.
. Click *View cluster* to view the _Overview_ page and a summary of your cluster.

*Note* You can continue to import more clusters.
Click *Import another* to repeat the process.
