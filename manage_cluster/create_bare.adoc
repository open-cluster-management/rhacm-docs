[#creating-a-cluster-on-bare-metal]
= Creating a cluster on bare metal

**Important:** The bare metal cluster function is a technology preview,and should not be used in production environments.

You can use the {product-title} console to create a {ocp} cluster in a bare metal environment.

NOTE: The options for bare metal in the console are a technology preview only, and are hidden by a feature flag by default.
See the instructions for enabling the feature flag in the _Prerequisites_ section.

[#bare_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites before creating a cluster in a bare metal environment:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.5, or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster in the bare metal environment
* Bare metal provider connection;
see xref:../manage_cluster/prov_conn_bare.adoc#creating-a-provider-connection-for-bare-metal[Creating a provider connection for bare metal] for more information
* Login credentials for your bare metal environment, which include user name, password, and Baseboard Management Controller Address
* A {ocp} image pull secret;
see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html[Using image pull secrets]
* Bare metal feature flags that are enabled to view the bare metal options.
The bare metal options are hidden by feature flags by default.
Complete the following steps to enable the feature flags:
 .. Start the {ocp} command line interface.
 .. Set the `featureFlags_baremetal` setting to *true* for the `console-header` container by entering the following command:
+
----
oc patch deploy console-header -n <namespace> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"console-header","env": [{"name": "featureFlags_baremetal","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'
----
Replace <namespace> with your {product-title-short} project namespace.
+
After the update, your `consoleui` CRD should look like the following example:
+
----
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - env:                              # Search for env:
        - name: featureFlags_baremetal
          value: "true"
        ...
----

 .. Set the `featureFlags_baremetal` value to *true* for the `hmc-ui` container:
+
----
oc patch -n <namespace> $(oc get deploy -o name | grep consoleui) -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"hcm-ui","env": [{"name": "featureFlags_baremetal","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'
----
Replace <namespace> with your {product-title-short} project namespace.
+
Your update should look like the following example:
+
----
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - env:                              # Search for env:
        - name: featureFlags_baremetal
          value: "true"
        ...
----

 .. Make sure the `+console-chart-...-consoleui...+` and `+console-header-...+` pods are running:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management get pods
----

 .. When the pods are running again, log out of the {product-title} console and log back in. The bare metal options are now included in the console.

**Note**: If you change your cloud provider access key, you must manually update the provisioned cluster access key. For more information, see the known issue, link:../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#automatic-secret-updates-for-provisioned-clusters-is-not-supported[Automatic secret updates for provisioned clusters is not supported].

[#bare_creating-your-cluster-with-the-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes-console]
== Creating your cluster with the {product-title} console

To create clusters from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the Clusters page, Click *Add Cluster*.
. Select *Create a cluster*.
+
NOTE: This procedure is for creating a cluster.
If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../manage_cluster/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

. Enter a name for your cluster.
This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.
+
TIP: You can view the `yaml` content updates as you enter the information in the console by setting the _YAML_ switch to *ON*.

. Select *Bare Metal* for the infrastructure platform.
. Specify a *Release image* that you want to use for the cluster.
This identifies the version of the {ocp} image that is used to create the cluster.
If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images.
If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the url to the image that you want to use.
See xref:../manage_cluster/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information about release images.
. Select your provider connection from the available connections on the list.
If you do not have one configured, or want to configure a new one, select *Add provider*. See xref:../manage_cluster/prov_conn_bare.adoc#creating-a-provider-connection-for-bare-metal[Creating a provider connection for bare metal] for more information about creating a provider connection.
. Enter the base domain information that you configured in your bare metal environment. If there is already a base domain associated with the selected provider connection, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it.
This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.
. Select your hosts from the list of hosts that are associated with your provider connection.
Select a minimum of three assets that are on the same bridge networks as the hypervisor.
. *Optional:* Configure the cluster networking options.
. *Optional:* Configure a label for the cluster.
. *Optional:* Update the advanced settings, if you want to change the setting for including a configmap.
. Click *Create*.
You can view your cluster details after the create and import process is complete.

+
NOTE: You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title}. 

[#bare_accessing-your-cluster]
== Accessing your cluster

To access a cluster that is managed by {product-title}, complete the following steps:

. From the {product-title} navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select the name of the cluster that you created or want to access.
The cluster details are displayed.
. Select *Reveal credentials* to view the user name and password for the cluster.
Note these values to use when you log in to the cluster.
. Select *Console URL* to link to the cluster.
. Log in to the cluster by using the user ID and password that you found in step 3.
. Select the _Actions_ menu for the cluster that you want to access.
. Select *Launch to cluster*.
+
TIP: If you already know the log in credentials, you can access the cluster by selecting the _Actions_ menu for the cluster, and selecting *Launch to cluster*.

[#bare_removing-a-cluster-from-management]
== Removing a cluster from management

When you remove a {ocp} cluster from management that was created with {product-title}, you can either _detach_ it or _destroy_ it.

Detaching a cluster removes it from management, but does not completely delete it.
You can import it again, if you decide that you want to bring it back under management.
This is only an option when the cluster is in a _Ready_ state.

Destroying a cluster removes it from management and deletes the components of the cluster.
This is permanent, and it cannot be brought back under management after deletion.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select the option menu beside the cluster that you want to delete.
. Select *Destroy cluster* or *Detach cluster*.
+
TIP: You can detach or destroy multiple clusters by selecting the check boxes of the clusters that you want to detach or destroy.
Then select *Detach* or *Destroy*.
