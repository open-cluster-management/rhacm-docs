[#creating-a-provider-connection-for-microsoft-azure]
= Creating a provider connection for Microsoft Azure

You need a provider connection to use {product-title} console to create and manage a {ocp} cluster on Microsoft Azure.

*Note:* This procedure is a prerequisite for creating a cluster with {product-title}.

[#azure_prov_conn_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a provider connection:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so that it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure
* Azure login credentials, which include your Base Domain Resource Group and Azure Service Principal JSON.
See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/azure-portal[azure.microsoft.com].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on Azure.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-configure-portal[How to configure Cloud Services] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.html[Configuring an Azure account] for more information.

== Creating a provider connection by using the console

To create a provider connection from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Provider connections_ tab.
+
Existing provider connections are displayed.

. Select *Add a connection*.
. Select *Microsoft Azure* as your provider.
. Add a name for your provider connection.
. Select a namespace for your provider connection from the list.
+
TIP: You can create a namespace specifically to host your provider connections, both for convenience and added security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your provider connection. If you add the base DNS domain to the provider connection, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this provider connection.
. Add your _Base Domain Resource Group Name_ for your Azure account.
This entry is the resource name that you created with your Azure account.
You can find your Base Domain Resource Group Name by selecting *Home* > *DNS Zones* in the Azure interface.
Your Base Domain Resource Group name is in the _Resource Group_ column of the entry that contains the Base DNS domain that applies to your account.
. Add your _Client ID_. This value is generated as the `appId` property when you create a service principal with the following command: 
+
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal>
----
Replace _service_principal_ with the name of your service principal.
. Add your _Client Secret_. This value is generated as the `password` property when you create a service principal with the following command:
+
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal>
----
Replace _service_principal_ with the name of your service principal.
. Add your _Subscription ID_. This value is the `id` property in the output of the following command:
+
----
az account show
----
. Add your _Tenant ID_. This value is the `tenantId` property in the output of the following command:
+
----
az account show
----
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH Private Key_ and _SSH Public Key_ to use to connect to the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new pair using a key generation program.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-default.html[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the provider connection, it is added to the list of provider connections.

You can create a cluster that uses this provider connection by completing the steps in xref:../manage_cluster/create_azure.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-microsoft-azure[Creating a cluster on Microsoft Azure].

[#azure_delete_provider_conn]
== Deleting your provider connection

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a provider connection, delete the provider connection to protect the information in the provider connection.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select *Provider connections*.
. Select the options menu for the provider connection that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete connection*.
