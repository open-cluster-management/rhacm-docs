[#creating-a-provider-connection-for-google-cloud-platform]
= Creating a provider connection for Google Cloud Platform

You need a provider connection to use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console to create and manage a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

NOTE: This procedure is a prerequisite for creating a cluster with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

[#google_prov_conn_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a provider connection:

* A deployed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster
* Internet access for your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on GCP
* GCP login credentials, which include user Google Cloud Platform Project ID and Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key.
See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[Creating and managing projects].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on GCP.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.html[Configuring a GCP project] for instructions on how to configure an account.

[#gcp_provider_conn]
== Creating a provider connection by using the console

To create a provider connection from the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the Clusters page, select the _Provider connections_ tab.
+
Existing provider connections are displayed.

. Select *Add a connection*.
. Select *Google Cloud Platform* as your provider.
. Add a name for your provider connection.
. Select a namespace for your provider connection from the list.
+
TIP: Create a namespace specifically to host your provider connections, for both convenience and security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your provider connection. If you add the base DNS domain to the provider connection, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this provider connection.
. Add your _Google Cloud Platform Project ID_ for your GCP account.
Log in to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey[GCP] to retrieve your settings.
. Add your _Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key_.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH Private Key_ and _SSH Public Key_ so you can access the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new pair using a key generation program.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-default.html[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the provider connection, it is added to the list of provider connections.

You can use this connection when you create a cluster by completing the steps in link:create_google.md.adoc[Creating a cluster on Google Cloud Platform].

[#gcp_delete_provider_conn]
== Deleting your provider connection

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a provider connection, delete the provider connection to protect the information in the provider connection.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select *Provider connections*.
. Select the options menu beside the provider connection that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete connection*.
