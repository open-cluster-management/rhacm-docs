[#creating-a-managedclusterset-resource]
= Creating a ManagedClusterSet resource

You can create a ManagedClusterSet resource to limit the user access on managed clusters. You must also create a ManagedClusterSetBinding resource to bind a ManagedClusterSet resource to a namespace. 

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

[#managedclusterset]
== ManagedClusterSet resource

A `ManagedClusterSet` represents a subset of managed clusters. You can group clusters and give user access to the group. A ManagedClusterSet resource can have multiple `clusterSelectors` to select managed clusters.

The `clusterSelectors` can contain a list of cluster names, or contain a list of labels. View the following options to create ManagedClusterSet resources:

* Create a ManagedClusterSet resource that contains a list of cluster names. Your resource might resemble the following information:

+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: clusterset1
spec:
  clusterSelectors:
  - clusterNames:
    - cluster1
    - cluster2
----

* Create a ManagedClusterSet resource that contain a list of labels. Your resource might resemble the following information:

+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: clusterset-prod
spec:
  clusterSelectors:
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: Prod
----

* Create a ManagedClusterSet resource that contains multiple `clusterSelectors`. Your resource might resemble the following information:

+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: clusterset-us-west
spec:
  clusterSelectors:
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        region: us-west-1
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        region: us-west-2

[#managedclustersetbinding]
== ManagedClusterSetBinding resource

Create a ManagedClusterSetBinding resource to bind a ManagedClusterSet resource to a namespace. Application and policies that are created in the same namespace can only access managed clusters that are included in the bound ManagedClusterSet resource.

When you create a ManagedClusterSetBinding, the name of the ManagedClusterSetBinding must match the name of the ManagedClusterSet to bind.

Your ManagedClusterSetBinding resource might resemble the following information:

----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: clusterset1
spec:
  clusterSet: clusterset1
----

A user must have the bind permission on the target ManagedClusterSet. View the following example of a ClusterRole resource, which contain rules that allow the user to bind to `clusterset1`:

----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/bind"]
    resourceNames: ["clusterset1"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----
