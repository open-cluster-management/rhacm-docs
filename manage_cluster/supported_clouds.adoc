[#configuring-kubectl]
== Configuring kubectl

From vendor documentation previously listed, you might need to learn how configure your `kubectl`.
You must have `kubectl` installed when you import a managed cluster to a hub cluster. See xref:../manage_cluster/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for details.
