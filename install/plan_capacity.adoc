[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your cluster

Each {product-title} cluster has its own characteristics.
There are guidelines that provide sample deployment sizes.
They have been classified by size and purpose.
The considerations are focused on clusters that are either deployed to VMware or OpenStack environments.

{product-title-short} applies the following 3 dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* Availability Zones that isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters should have roughly equivalent worker node capacity in 3 or more availability zones. 
* vCPU reservations and limits establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equivalent to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].
* Memory reservations and limits establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. Reservations establish a lower bound of CPU or memory and limits establish an upper bound.

The persistent data managed by the product is stored in the cluster-wide etcd data store. Best practices for OpenShift recommend distributing the master nodes of the cluster across three (3) availability zones, as well.

*Note:* The requirements that are listed are not minimum requirements.

In addition to {product-title}, the OpenShift cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. The following list contains the recommended sizes of the three (3) installed nodes that are distributed across availability zones for each of the providers.
