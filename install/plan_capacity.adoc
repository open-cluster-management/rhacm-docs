[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your cluster

Each {product-title} cluster is unique. There are guidelines that provide sample deployment sizes. Recommendations are classified by size and purpose. {product-title-short} applies the following three dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* Availability Zones isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters should have nearly equivalent worker node capacity in three or more availability zones. 

* vCPU reservations and limits establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equivalent to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].

* Memory reservations and limits establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. Reservations establish a _lower_ bound of CPU or memory, and limits establish an _upper_ bound.

The persistent data managed by the product is stored in the etcd cluster used by Kubernetes. *Best practice:* For OpenShift, distribute the master nodes of the cluster across three (3) availability zones.

**Note:** The following requirements are not minimum requirements.

In addition to {product-title-short}, the {ocp} cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. The following node sizes (3 nodes of the types noted in the information that follows, distributed evenly across 3 availability zones) are recommended.
