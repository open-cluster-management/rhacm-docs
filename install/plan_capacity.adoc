[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your cluster

Each {product-title} cluster has its own characteristics. There are guidelines that provide sample deployment sizes. Recommendations are classified by size and purpose.

{product-title-short} applies the following 3 dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* Availability Zones that isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters should have roughly equivalent worker node capacity in 3 or more availability zones. 

* vCPU reservations and limits establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equivalent to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].

* Memory reservations and limits establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. Reservations establish a lower bound of CPU or memory and limits establish an upper bound.

The persistent data managed by the product is stored in the etcd cluster used by Kubernetes. Best practices for OpenShift recommend distributing the master nodes of the cluster across three (3) availability zones as well.

**Note:** The requirements that are listed are not minimum requirements.

In addition to {product-title-short}, the {ocp} cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. The following node sizes (3 nodes of the types noted in the information that follows, distributed evenly across 3 availability zones) are recommended.
