# Supported managed cloud providers

Learn about the Cluster API cloud providers that are available with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. Also, find the documented managed providers that are available.

  - [Supported managed cluster cloud providers](#providers-managed)
  - [Configuring kubectl](#kubectl)

OpenShift 4.2 is supported for the hub cluster and managed clusters.

**Best practice:** For managed cluster cloud providers, use latest version of Kubernetes.

## Configuring kubectl
{: #kubectl} 

From each cloud provider documentation, you might need to learn how configure your `kubectl`. You must have `kubectl` installed. For more information, see the _Overview of kubectl_ in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/). 

Each cloud provider process to configure `kubectl` is different, so view the product documentation for details.
