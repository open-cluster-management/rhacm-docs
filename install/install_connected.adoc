{product-title} is installed using an operator that deploys all of the required components.

[#connect_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must meet the following requirements before you install {product-title-short}:

* Your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform must have access to the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator in the OperatorHub catalog.
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.3, or later, must be deployed in your environment, and you must be logged into it with the CLI.
See the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/welcome/index.html[OpenShift version 4.3 documentation] or https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/welcome/index.html[OpenShift version 4.4 documentation].
* A StorageClass that is configured in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to create storage for {product-title-short}.
For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.html#local-storage-install_persistent-storage-local[Installing the Local Storage Operator] for OpenShift Container Platform.
+
NOTE: If the StorageClass is not configured, you must create and configure a StorageClass in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
For more information, see _Defining a StorageClass_ in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html#defining-storage-classes_dynamic-provisioning[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].

* Your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform command line interface (CLI) must be version 4.3, or later, and configured to run `oc` commands.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the CLI] for information about installing and configuring the Red Hat OpenShift CLI.
* Your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform permissions must allow you to create a namespace.
* You must have an Internet connection to access the dependencies for the operator.

== Installing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management from the CLI

. Create a namespace where the operator requirements are contained:
+
----
oc create namespace <namespace>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with a name for your namespace.
+
IMPORTANT: The {product-title-short} operator must be installed in its own namespace.
A `ServiceAccount` with a `ClusterRoleBinding` automatically gives cluster administrator privileges to {product-title-short} and to any ID with access to the namespace.
For security, make sure that anyone who is given access to this namespace already has cluster-administrator access.

. Switch your project namespace to the one that you created:
+
----
oc project <namespace>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with the name of the namespace that you created in step 1.

. Create an operator group.
Each namespace can have only one operator group.
 .. Create a `.yaml` file that defines the operator group.
Your file should look similar to the following example:
+
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: <default>
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - <namespace>
----
+
Replace _default_ with the name of your operator group.
Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace.

 .. Apply the file that you created to define the operator group:
+
----
oc apply -f local/<operator-group>.yaml
----
+
Replace _operator-group_ with the name of the operator group `.yaml` file that you created.
. Apply the subscription.
 .. Create a `.yaml` file that defines the subscription.
Your file should look similar to the following example:
+
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: acm-operator-subscription
spec:
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  source: redhat-operators
  channel: release-1.0
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: advanced-cluster-management
----

 .. Apply the subscription:
+
----
oc apply -f local/<subscription>.yaml
----
+
Replace _subscription_ with the name of the subscription file that you created.
. If you plan to import Kubernetes clusters that were not created by OpenShift Container Platform or Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, generate a pull secret to access the entitled content from the distribution registry.
Pull secret requirements for OpenShift Container Platform clusters are automatically resolved by OpenShift Container Platform and {product-title-short}.
You do not have to generate the pull secret if you are not importing other types of Kubernetes clusters to be managed.
*Important:* Pull secrets are namespace-specific, so make sure that you are in the namespace that you created in step 1.
 .. Download your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret file from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] by selecting *Download pull secret*.
Your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.
 .. Run the following command to generate your pull secret:
+
----
oc create secret generic <secret> -n <namespace> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path-to-pull-secret> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
Replace _secret_ with the name of the secret that you want to create.
Replace _namespace_ with your project namespace.
Replace _path-to-pull-secret_ with the path to your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret that you downloaded.
. Create the MultiClusterHub custom resource by creating a `.yaml` file that defines the custom resource.
Your file should look similar to the following example:
+
----
apiVersion: operators.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with your project namespace.
Replace _secret_ with the name of the secret that you created.
+
If this step fails with the following error, the resources are still being created and applied:
+
----
   error: unable to recognize "./mch.yaml": no matches for kind "MultiClusterHub" in version "operators.open-cluster-                       management.io/v1beta1"
----
+
Run the command again in a few minutes when the resources are created.

. View the list of routes after about 10 minutes to find your route:
+
----
oc get routes
----

== Installing {product-title-short} from the console

. Create a namespace for the operator requirements:
 .. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console navigation, select *Administration* > *Namespaces*.
 .. Select *Create Namespace*.
 .. Provide a name for your namespace.
This is the namespace that you use throughout the installation process.
 .. Select *Create*.
+
IMPORTANT: The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator must be installed in its own namespace.
A `ServiceAccount` with a `ClusterRoleBinding` automatically gives cluster administrator privileges to {product-title-short} and to any ID with access to the namespace.
For security, make sure that anyone who is given access to this namespace already has cluster-administrator access.
. Switch your project namespace to the one that you created in step 1.
This ensures that the steps are completed in the correct namespace.
Some resources are namespace-specific.
 .. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console navigation, select *Administration* > *Namespaces*.
 .. In the _Projects_ field, select the namespace that you created in step 1 from the dropdown list.
. Create a pull secret that provides the entitlement to the downloads.
 .. Copy your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] by selecting *Copy pull secret*.
You will use the content of this pull secret in an step later in this procedure.
Your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.
 .. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console navigation, select *Workloads* > *Secrets*.
 .. Select *Create* > *Image Pull Secret*.
 .. Enter a name for your secret.
 .. Select *Upload Configuration File* as the authentication type.
 .. In the _Configuration file_ field, paste the pull secret that you copied from `cloud.redhat.com`.
 .. Select *Create* to create the pull secret.
. Subscribe to the operator.
 .. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console navigation, select *Operators* > *OperatorHub*.
 .. Select *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management*.
*Tip:* You can filter on the _Integration & Delivery_ category to narrow the choices.
 .. Select *Install*.
 .. Update the values, if necessary.
 .. Select *Subscribe*.
. Create the _MultiClusterHub_ custom resource.
 .. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console navigation, select *Installed Operators* > *MultiClusterHub*.
 .. Select the *MultiClusterHub* tab.
 .. Select *Create MultiClusterHub*.
 .. Update the default values in the `.yaml` file, according to your needs.
The following example shows some sample data:
+
----
apiVersion: operators.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----
+
Replace _secret_ with the name of the pull secret that you created.
Confirm that the _namespace_ is your project namespace.
. Select *Create* to initialize the custom resource.
It can take up to 10 minutes for the hub to build and start.
+
After the hub is created, the status for the operator is _Running_ on the _Installed Operators_ page.

. Access the console for the hub.
 .. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console navigation, select *Networking* > *Routes*.
 .. View the URL for your hub in the list, and navigate to it to access the console for your hub.
