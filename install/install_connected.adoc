See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the CLI] for information about installing and configuring the {ocp-short} CLI.
* Your {ocp-short} permissions must allow you to create a namespace.
* You must have an Internet connection to access the dependencies for the operator.

#installing-on-infra-node
== Preparing to install the hub cluster on an infrastructure node

Tolerations exist in the deployment of the {product-title} version 2.2 hub cluster that allow hub cluster components to be installed on an infrastructure node. 

To install the hub cluster on an infrastructure node, complete the following steps to prepare:

. Configure your infrastructure nodes as infrastructure machine sets according to the procedure in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.html[Creating infrastructure machine sets] in the {ocp} documentation.
+
The following content shows the source of the toleration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule 
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra 
    operator: Exists 
----

. Add the following `nodeSelector` entry to the MultclusterHub resource _object_ section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
----

. Complete the steps in #installing-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-from-the-operatorhub[Installing from the OperatorHub] or #installing-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-from-the-cli[Installing from the CLI] to finish installing the hub cluster. 

[#installing-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-from-the-operatorhub]
== Installing from the OperatorHub

Installing by using the OperatorHub that is provided with {ocp-short} is the easiest way to install {product-title-short}. 

. In your {ocp-short} navigation, select *Operators* > *OperatorHub* to access the list of available operators.

. Find and select the _Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes_ operator.

. On the _Operator subscription_ page, select the options for your installation:
+
* Namespace: {product-title-short} must be installed in its own namespace, or project. The default value is that the installation process creates a namespace titled `open-cluster-management`, and installs in that namespace. If there is already a namespace named `open-cluster-management`, you cannot complete the installation with that option. In that case, you must select the option to install to an existing namespace and select it from the list. 
+
*Important:* A `ServiceAccount` with a `ClusterRoleBinding` automatically gives cluster administrator privileges to {product-title-short} and to any user credentials with access to the namespace where you install {product-title-short}.
The installation also creates a namespace called `local-cluster` that is reserved for the hub cluster when it is managed by itself. There cannot be an existing namespace called `local-cluster`. For security reasons, do not give anyone access to the `local-cluster` namespace who does not already have cluster-administrator access.
+
* Channel: The channel that you select corresponds to the release that you are installing. When you select the channel, it installs the identified release and establishes that the future z-stream updates within that release are obtained.
+
* Approval strategy: The approval strategy identifies the human interaction that is required for applying updates to the channel or release to which you subscribed. If you select *Automatic* updates, any updates within that release are automatically applied. If you have concerns about when the updates are applied, you can select *Manual*, and receive a notification when an update is available. 
+
*Note:* Automatic upgrades do not span across major releases, for example, 2.0 to 2.1. To upgrade to the next major release, you must return to the OperatorHub page and select a new channel for the more current release. 

. Select *Subscribe* to apply your changes and create the operator. 

. If you plan to import Kubernetes clusters that were not created by {ocp-short} or {product-title-short}, create a secret that contains your {ocp-short} pull secret to access the entitled content from the distribution registry. Secret requirements for {ocp-short} clusters are automatically resolved by {ocp-short} and {product-title-short}, so you do not have to create the secret if you are not importing other types of Kubernetes clusters to be managed.
+
*Important:* These secrets are namespace-specific, so be sure to create a secret in the namespace where you installed {product-title-short}.
+
 .. Copy your {ocp-short} pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] by selecting *Copy pull secret*.
You will use the content of this pull secret in a step later in this procedure.
Your {ocp-short} pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.
 .. In the {ocp-short} console navigation, select *Workloads* > *Secrets*.
 .. Select *Create* > *Image Pull Secret*.
 .. Enter a name for your secret.
 .. Select *Upload Configuration File* as the authentication type.
 .. In the _Configuration file_ field, paste the pull secret that you copied from `cloud.redhat.com`.
 .. Select *Create* to create the secret.

. Create the _MultiClusterHub_ custom resource.
 .. In the {ocp-short} console navigation, select *Installed Operators* > *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes*.
 .. Select the *MultiClusterHub* tab.
 .. Select *Create MultiClusterHub*.
 .. Update the default values in the `.yaml` file, according to your needs.
+
* The following example shows the default template if you did not create an image pull secret:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
----
+
Confirm that the _namespace_ is your project namespace.

* The following example shows the default template if you created an image pull secret:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----
+
Replace _secret_ with the name of the pull secret that you created.
Confirm that the _namespace_ is your project namespace.
+
*Important:* The `local-cluster` namespace is used for the imported self-managed hub cluster. You must not have a local-cluster namespace on your cluster prior to installing. After the `local-cluster` namespace is created for the hub cluster, anyone who has access to the `local-cluster` namespace is automatically granted _cluster administrator_ access. For security reasons, do not give anyone access to the `local-cluster` namespace who does not already have cluster-administrator access. 
 .. *Optional:* Disable hub self management, if necessary. By default, the hub cluster is automatically imported and managed by itself, like any other cluster. If you do not want the hub cluster to manage itself, then change the setting for `disableHubSelfManagement` from `false` to `true`. If the setting is not included in the `.yaml` file that defines the custom resource, add it as shown in the example of the previous step. The following example shows the default template to use if you want to disable the hub self-management feature:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  disableHubSelfManagement: true
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace.

. Select *Create* to initialize the custom resource.
It can take up to 10 minutes for the hub to build and start.
+
After the hub is created, the status for the operator is _Running_ on the _Installed Operators_ page.

. Access the console for the hub.
 .. In the {ocp-short} console navigation, select *Networking* > *Routes*.
 .. View the URL for your hub in the list, and navigate to it to access the console for your hub.

If you are reinstalling {product-title-short} and the pods do not start, see link:../troubleshooting/trouble_reinstall.adoc#troubleshooting-reinstallation-failure[Troubleshooting reinstallation failure] for steps to work around this problem.

[#installing-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-from-the-cli]
== Installing from the CLI

. Create a hub cluster namespace where the operator requirements are contained:
+
----
oc create namespace <namespace>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with a name for your hub cluster namespace. **Note:** The value for _namespace_ might be referred to as _Project_ in the {ocp} environment. 
+
*Important:* A `ServiceAccount` with a `ClusterRoleBinding` automatically gives cluster administrator privileges to {product-title-short} and to any user credentials with access to the namespace where you install {product-title-short}.
The installation also creates a namespace called `local-cluster` that is reserved for the hub cluster when it is managed by itself. There cannot be an existing namespace called `local-cluster`. For security reasons, do not give anyone access to the `local-cluster` namespace who does not already have cluster-administrator access.

. Switch your project namespace to the one that you created:
+
----
oc project <namespace>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with the name of the hub cluster namespace that you created in step 1.

. If you plan to import Kubernetes clusters that were not created by {ocp-short} or {product-title-short}, generate a secret that contains your {ocp-short} pull secret information to access the entitled content from the distribution registry.
The secret requirements for {ocp-short} clusters are automatically resolved by {ocp-short} and {product-title-short}, so you do not have to create the secret if you are not importing other types of Kubernetes clusters to be managed.
*Important:* These secrets are namespace-specific, so make sure that you are in the namespace that you created in step 1.
 .. Download your {ocp-short} pull secret file from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] by selecting *Download pull secret*.
Your {ocp-short} pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.
 .. Run the following command to create your secret:
+
----
oc create secret generic <secret> -n <namespace> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path-to-pull-secret> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
Replace _secret_ with the name of the secret that you want to create.
Replace _namespace_ with your project namespace, as the secrets are namespace-specific.
Replace _path-to-pull-secret_ with the path to your {ocp-short} pull secret that you downloaded.

. Create an operator group.
Each namespace can have only one operator group.
 .. Create a `.yaml` file that defines the operator group.
Your file should look similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: <default>
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - <namespace>
----
+
Replace _default_ with the name of your operator group.
Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace.

 .. Apply the file that you created to define the operator group:
+
----
oc apply -f local/<operator-group>.yaml
----
+
Replace _operator-group_ with the name of the operator group `.yaml` file that you created.

. Apply the subscription.
 .. Create a `.yaml` file that defines the subscription.
Your file should look similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: acm-operator-subscription
spec:
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  source: redhat-operators
  channel: release-2.1
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: advanced-cluster-management
----

 .. Apply the subscription:
+
----
oc apply -f local/<subscription>.yaml
----
+
Replace _subscription_ with the name of the subscription file that you created.

. Apply the MultiClusterHub custom resource.

 .. Create a `.yaml` file that defines the custom resource.
+
* Your default template should look similar to the following example, if you did not create a pull secret:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace.
+
* Your default template should look similar to the following example, if you created a pull secret:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace.
+
Replace _secret_ with the name of your pull secret. 

.. *Optional:* Disable hub self management, if necessary. By default, the hub cluster is automatically imported and managed by itself, like any other cluster. If you do not want the hub cluster to manage itself, then change the setting for `disableHubSelfManagement` from `false` to `true`. Your default template should look similar to the following example, if you created a pull secret and are enabling the `disableHubSelfManagement` feature:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
  disableHubSelfManagement: true
----
+
Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace.
+
Replace _secret_ with the name of your pull secret. 

 .. Apply the custom resource:
+
----
oc apply -f local/<custom-resource>.yaml
----
+
Replace _custom-resource_ with the name of your custom resource file.
+
*Important:* The `local-cluster` namespace is used for the imported self-managed hub cluster. You must not have a local-cluster namespace on your cluster prior to installing. After the `local-cluster` namespace is created for the hub cluster, anyone who has access to the `local-cluster` namespace is automatically granted _cluster administrator_ access. For security reasons, do not give anyone access to the `local-cluster` namespace who does not already have cluster-administrator access. 
+
If this step fails with the following error, the resources are still being created and applied:
+
----
error: unable to recognize "./mch.yaml": no matches for kind "MultiClusterHub" in version "operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1"
----
+
Run the command again in a few minutes when the resources are created.

. It can take up to 10 minutes for the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource status to show as `Running` in the _status.phase_ field after you run the following command:
+
----
oc get mch -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status.phase}'
----

. After the status is `Running`, view the list of routes to find your route:
+
----
oc get routes
----

If you are reinstalling {product-title-short} and the pods do not start, see link:../troubleshooting/trouble_reinstall.adoc#troubleshooting-reinstallation-failure[Troubleshooting reinstallation failure] for steps to work around this problem.
