[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the following connections:

Hub cluster:

* Outbound connectivity to the API of the cloud provider
* Outbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server of the provisioned managed cluster on port 6443
* Outbound connectivity from the hub cluster to the channel source, including GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
* Outbound and inbound connectivity to the `WorkManager` service route on the managed cluster on port 443
* Inbound connectivity to the kube API server of the hub cluster from the managed cluster on port 6443
* Inbound connectivity for post-commit hook from GitHub to the hub cluster. This setting is only required when you use certain application management functions.

Managed cluster:

* Inbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server from the hub cluster on port 6443
* Inbound connectivity to `WorkManager` service endpoint from the hub cluster on port 443
* Outbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server of the hub cluster on port 6443
* Outbound connectivity from the managed cluster to the channel source, which includes GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using application lifecycle to connect to these sources.

Clusters that are using Submariner require three open ports. The following examples show which ports you might use:

* Inbound and outbound on each of the managed clusters on port 4800/UDP
* Inbound on each of the managed cluster on port 8080/TCP
* Inbound and outbound on each of the managed clusters on ports 4500/UDP, 500/UDP, and any other ports that are used for IPSec traffic on the gateway nodes
