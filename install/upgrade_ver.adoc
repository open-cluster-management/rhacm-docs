[#upgrading]
= Upgrading

You can upgrade your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes operator from version 1.0 to version 1.0.1.
When you installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, you selected to enable Automatic upgrades or Manual upgrades.

*Important*: Upgrade from the product technology preview to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes version 2.0.0 is not supported.

[#automatic-upgrade]
== Automatic upgrade

If you selected Automatic upgrades when you installed the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator, the Operator Lifecycle Manager automatically upgrades the version when a compatible upgrade is available.
You do not have to do anything to upgrade.
This method ensures that you always have the latest version of the operator with the latest fixes.

[#manual-upgrade]
== Manual upgrade

If you selected Manual upgrades when you installed the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator, the cluster administrator determines when an upgrade occurs.
When a compatible upgrade is available, the Operator Lifecycle Manager creates a request to upgrade.
Someone with cluster administrator access must approve the request to upgrade to the new version.

For more information about upgrading your operator, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding operators to a cluster].
