[#discovery-enable-cli]
= Enable Discovery using the CLI

Enable discovery using the CLI to find clusters that are available from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager (link).

**Required access**: Cluster administrator

[#enable-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Create a credential to connect to Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

[#setup-discovery]
== Discovery set up and process

*Note:* The `DiscoveryConfig` must be named `discoveryconfig`. See the following simple `DiscoveryConfig` sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: DiscoveryConfig
metadata:
  name: discoveryconfig
spec:
  providerConnections:
    - <SECRET_NAME>
  filters:
    age: 7
----

. Replace `SECRET_NAME` with the provider connection that you previously set up
. Enter the maximum age of your cluster (in days) to discover. For example, `age: 7` means only clusters created in the last 7 days are discovered.

[#refresh-discovery]
=== DiscoveredClusterRefresh

The `DiscoveredClusterRefresh` object initiates the controller reconcile. After the reconcile completes, the controller deletes the `DiscoveredClusterRefresh` object with the `discoveredclusterrefreshes.discovery.open-cluster-management.io` API.

See the following sample of `DiscoveredClusterRefresh` in Operator Lifecycle Manager:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: DiscoveredClusterRefresh
metadata:
  name: discoveredclusterrefresh-sample
spec: {}
----

[#discovered-clusters]
=== DiscoveredClusters

These objects are created by the Discovery controller. These `DiscoveredClusters` represent the clusters that are found in OCM by using the filters and credentials that are specified in the `DiscoveryConfig` `discoveredclusters.discovery.open-cluster-management.io` API.

The majority of the data in the DiscoveredCluster object comes from the Operator Lifecycle Manager. See the following sample:
