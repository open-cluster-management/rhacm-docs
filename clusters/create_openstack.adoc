[#creating-a-cluster-on-openstack]
= Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform

You can use the {product-title} console to deploy a {ocp} cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

[#openstack-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform:

* A {product-title-short} hub cluster that is deployed on {ocp-short} version 4.6, or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
* A Red Hat OpenStack Platform credential. See link:../credentials/credential_openstack.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openstack[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.
* A {ocp-short} image pull secret. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html[Using image pull secrets].
* The following information for the Red Hat OpenStack Platform instance where you are deploying:
** Flavor name for the master and worker instances.  For example, m1.xlarge.
** Network name for the external network that will provide the floating IP addresses.
** Required floating IP addresses for API and ingress instances.
** DNS records for:
*** `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which must point to the floating IP address for the API.
*** `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which must point to the floating IP address for ingress.

[#openstack-creating-your-cluster-with-the-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes-console]
== Creating your cluster with the {product-title} console

To create clusters from the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Clusters*.

. On the _Cluster management_ page, click the *Clusters* tab.

. Click *Create cluster*.
+
*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster.
If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../clusters/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

. Enter a name for your cluster.
This name is used in the hostname of the cluster. The name must contain fewer than 15 characters.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the credential prerequisites section.
+
*Tip:* You can view the YAML content updates as you enter the information in the console by setting the _YAML_ switch to *ON*.

. Select *Red Hat OpenStack* for the infrastructure platform.

. Specify a *Release image* that you want to use for the cluster.
This identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster.
If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images.
If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the URL of the image that you want to use.
See xref:../clusters/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information.
*Note:* Only release images for {ocp-short} versions 4.5.x and higher are supported.

. Select your credentials from the available credentials on the list.
If you do not have one configured, or want to configure a new one, select *Add connection*. See link:../credentials/credential_openstack.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openstack[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information about creating a credential.

. *Optional:* Add the labels that you want to associate with your cluster. These labels help to identify the cluster and limit search results.

. Add the external network name. The external network name is the name for the external Red Hat OpenStack Platform network.

. Add the API floating IP address. The existing floating IP address is for the the external network for the {ocp-short} API. 
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. 

. Add the ingress floating IP address. The existing floating IP address is on the external network for the ingress port.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section.

. *Optional:* Add the external DNS value. The external DNS address is included when you need name resolution on the private network.

. Configure the _Node pools_ for your cluster.
+
The node pools define the location and size of the nodes that are used for your cluster. This is where you define the flavor for the master and worker nodes.
+
You can create one or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools.

. Configure the cluster networking options, which are shown in the following list:
+
* Base DNS domain information that you configured for Red Hat OpenStack Platform. If there is already a base domain associated with the selected credential, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it. 
+
**Note:** This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section.
+
This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.

* Network type specifies the pod network provider plug-in to deploy. The possible values are **OVNKubernetes** or **OpenShiftSDN**. The default value is `OpenShiftSDN`.

* The values of the network information for your cluster. You must provide the values for one or more networks for an IPv4 network. For an IPv6 network, you must define more than one network. The required values for each network are:
+
** Cluster network CIDR - The group of IP addresses that are reserved for use by the cluster. Ensure that you specify enough for your cluster, and that they do not include the IP addresses of other clusters in the range.
** Network host prefix - The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node.
** Service network CIDR - A block of IP addresses for services. Ensure that the IP addresses in the block do not overlap IP addresses in other blocks.
** Machine CIDR - A block of IP addresses used by the {ocp-short} hosts. Ensure that the IP addresses in the block do not overlap IP addresses in other blocks. 
 
. Click *Create*.
You can view your cluster details after the create and import process is complete.
+
*Note:* When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title-short}. You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster.

[#openstack-accessing-your-cluster]
== Accessing your cluster

To access a cluster that is managed by {product-title-short}, complete the following steps:

. From the {product-title-short} navigation menu, navigate to *Clusters*.
. Select the name of the cluster that you created or want to access.
The cluster details are displayed.
. Select *Reveal credentials* to view the user name and password for the cluster.
Use these values when you log in to the cluster.
. Select *Console URL* to link to the cluster.
. Log in to the cluster by using the user ID and password that you found in step 3.
