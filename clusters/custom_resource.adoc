[#managedclustersets]
= ManagedClusterSets

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a group of managed clusters. With a `ManagedClusterSet`, you can manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. You can also create a ManagedClusterSetBinding resource to bind a ManagedClusterSet resource to a namespace.

[#creating-a-managedclusterset]
== Creating a ManagedClusterSet

You can group managed clusters together in a ManagedClusterSet to limit the user access on managed clusters.  

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a cluster-scoped resource, so you must have cluster administration permissions for the cluster where you are creating the `ManagedClusterSet`. A managed cluster cannot be included in more than one `ManagedClusterSet`. Complete the following steps to create a `ManagedClusterSet`:

. Add the following definition of the `ManagedClusterSet` to your `yaml` file:
+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <clusterset1>
----
+
Replace _clusterset1_ with the name of your `ManagedClusterSet`. 

[#adding-clusters-to-a-managedclusterset]
== Adding clusters to a ManagedClusterSet

After your `ManagedClusterSet` is created, you must add one or more managed clusters. Complete the following steps to add managed clusters:

. Ensure that there is an RBAC `ClusterRole` entry that allows you to `Create` on a virtual subresource of `managedclustersets/join`. Without this permission, you cannot assign a managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`. 
+
If this entry does not exist, add it to your `yaml` file. A sample entry resembles the following content:
+
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/join"]
    resourceNames: ["clusterset1"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----
+
Replace _clusterset1_ with the name of your `ManagedClusterSet`.
+
*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one `ManagedClusterSet` to another, you must have that permission available on both `ManagedClusterSets`. 

. Find the definition of the managed cluster in the `yaml` file. The section of the managed cluster definition where you add a label resembles the following content:
+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true 
----
+
In this example, _cluster1_ is the name of the managed cluster.

. Add a label that specifies the name of the `ManagedClusterSet` in the format: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1`.
+
Your code resembles the following example:
+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
----
+
In this example, _cluster1_ is the cluster that is added to the _clusterset1_ `ManagedClusterSet`.
+
*Note:* If the managed cluster was previously assigned to a `ManagedClusterSet` that was deleted, the managed cluster might have a `ManagedClusterSet` already specified to a cluster set that does not exist. If so, replace the name with the new one.

[#removing-a-managed-cluster-from-a-managedclusterset]
== Removing a managed cluster from a ManagedClusterSet

You might want to remove a managed cluster from a `ManagedClusterSet` to move it to a different `ManagedClusterSet`, or remove it from the management settings of the set.

To remove a managed cluster from a `ManagedClusterSet`, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to display a list of managed clusters in the `ManagedClusterSet`:
+
----
kubectl get managedclusters -l cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<clusterset1>
----
+
Replace _clusterset1_ with the name of the `ManagedClusterSet`.

. Locate the entry for the cluster that you want to remove.

. Remove the label from the the `yaml` entry for the cluster that you want to remove. See the following code for an example of the label:
+
----
labels:
   cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1
----
+
*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one `ManagedClusterSet` to another, you must have the RBAC permission available on both `ManagedClusterSets`.

[#managedclustersetbinding]
== ManagedClusterSetBinding resource

Create a ManagedClusterSetBinding resource to bind a ManagedClusterSet resource to a namespace. Application and policies that are created in the same namespace can only access managed clusters that are included in the bound ManagedClusterSet resource.

When you create a ManagedClusterSetBinding, the name of the ManagedClusterSetBinding must match the name of the ManagedClusterSet to bind.

Your ManagedClusterSetBinding resource might resemble the following information:

----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: clusterset1
spec:
  clusterSet: clusterset1
----

You must have the bind permission on the target ManagedClusterSet. View the following example of a ClusterRole resource, which contain rules that allow the user to bind to `clusterset1`:

----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/bind"]
    resourceNames: ["clusterset1"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----
