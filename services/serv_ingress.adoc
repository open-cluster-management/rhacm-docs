[#enabling-a-kubernetes-ingress-for-discovery]
= Enabling a Kubernetes ingress for discovery

You can configure the {product-title} service registry to discover Kubernetes ingresses that are on different {product-title} managed clusters.

When you have multiple Kubernetes ingresses that are managed by {product-title}, it is challenging to maintain them.
The {product-title} service discovery function discovers Kubernetes ingresses that are configured to be discovered.

*Required user type or access level:* Cluster administrator

The plug-in for the Kubernetes ingress discovery must be enabled when you import your target managed cluster if you want to discover a Kubernetes ingress in your managed clusters.

[#discover-the-kubernetes-ingress]
== Discover the Kubernetes ingress

To discover a Kubernetes ingress within your managed clusters, complete the following steps:

. Annotate an ingress with service discovery annotation.
+
You must enable the ingress in the managed cluster to be discovered by adding the following annotation to the `yaml` file for the ingress that you want to discover:
+
----
mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery
----
+
The following example shows how to add this to the ingress:
+
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta2
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dbing
  namespace: database
  annotations:
    mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: "{}"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: mydb.database.mcm.svc
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /db
        backend:
         serviceName: dbservice
         servicePort: 8000
----
+
*Tip:* You can append the service registry DNS suffix (mcm.svc) to your ingress host name, then you can access the ingress host directly using the host name.

. By default, the annotated ingress can be discovered on all managed clusters.
If you want to discover the service on specific managed clusters, add the `target-clusters` in the annotation, as shown in the following example:
+
----
mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: '{"target-clusters": ["cluster1", "cluster2"]}'
----

. Access the discovered ingress by using the ingress host name.
In this example, the host name is `mydb.database.mcm.svc`.
