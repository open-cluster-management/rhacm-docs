= Preparing your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to discover services

You can configure the {product-title} service registry to discover Kubernetes services, Kubernetes ingress services, and Istio services that are in different {product-title} managed clusters.

When you have multiple instances of a Kubernetes service, a Kubernetes ingress service, or an Istio service that are managed by {product-title}, it is challenging to maintain them.
The {product-title} service discovery function only discovers Kubernetes services, Kubernetes ingress services, and Istio services that are configured to be discovered.

*Required user type or access level:* Cluster administrator

When you import your target managed cluster (see link:../manage_cluster#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster]) from your {product-title}, you can configure your service registry component by editing the `serviceRegistry` section in your cluster import YAML file, for example:

----
   ...

   # Configure multicluster service registry feature
   serviceRegistry:
     enabled: true
     dnsSuffix: "mcm.svc"
     plugins: "kube-service"
   ...
----

Table 1: The following table lists the parameters and descriptions that are available in the YAML file:

|===
| Parameter | Description | Default value

| enabled
| Service registry that is used to discover services that are deployed by Application Deployable among managed clusters.
| true

| dnsSuffix
| The suffix of the registry DNS name, which is added to the end of the target clusters dns domain name.
| mcm.svc

| plugins
| Comma-separated list of enabled plugins.
Supported plugins: `kube-service`, `kube-ingress`, and `istio`.
| kube-service

[#configure-dns]
== Configure DNS

Configure the DNS for each target managed cluster by completing these steps:

*Note:* The DNS configuration is dependent on the kind of your managed cluster.
You can consult your cluster administrator for more details.
The following steps are based on {ocp} 4.3:

. Find the `mcm-svc-registry-dns` service cluster IP by entering the following command, where _rcm-klusterlet-namespace_ is the namespace that contains your registry component:
+
----
kubectl get -n <rcm-klusterlet-namespace> service mcm-svc-registry-dns -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
----

. Configure your cluster DNS configuration by entering the following command:
+
----
oc edit dns.operator/default
----

. Enable the forwarding plugin in the `default` configuration.
Your content should look similar to the following example, where _mcm-svc-registry-dns-service-cluster-ip_ is the IP address that you identified in step 1:
+
----
spec:
  servers:

  ...

  - name: mcm-server
    zones:
      - mcm.svc
    forwardPlugin:
      upstreams:
        - <mcm-svc-registry-dns-service-cluster-ip>
----
+
The value `mcm.svc` is from the value of `dnsSuffix` in the `serviceRegistry` previous configuration.
