[#enabling-an-istio-service-for-discovery]
= Enabling an Istio service for discovery

You can configure the {product-title} service registry to discover Istio services that are in different {product-title} managed clusters.

When you have multiple instances of an Istio service that are managed by {product-title}, it is challenging to maintain them.
The {product-title} service discovery function discovers Istio services that are configured to be discovered.

*Required user type or access level:* Cluster administrator.

The plug-in for the Istio discovery must be enabled when you import your target managed cluster if you want to discover an Istio service in your managed clusters.

NOTE: If you enable the Istio plug-in, you need to install the https://istio.io/docs/concepts/multicluster-deployments/#multicluster-service-mesh[Multicluster service mesh].
The mesh must include individually deployed Istio control planes in every cluster and must use gateways to connect services across clusters.

== Discover the Istio service

To discover an Istio service within the managed clusters, complete the following steps:

. Add a service discovery annotation to the Istio service.
You must add the annotation to your Istio service definition YAML file for the service that you want to discover.
+
----
mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery
----
+
The following example shows how to add the annotation to the service definition YAML file:
+
----
apiVersion: v1	
kind: Service	
metadata:	
 annotations:	
   mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: "{}"	
 name: dbservice	
 namespace: database	
spec:	
 ports:	
 - name: http	
    nodePort: 8080	
    port: 8000	
    protocol: TCP	
 selector:	
   app: dbservice
----

. By default, the annotated service can be discovered on all managed clusters.
If you want to discover the service on specific managed clusters, add `target-clusters` in the annotation, as shown in the following example:
+
----
mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: '{"target-clusters": ["cluster1", "cluster2"]}'
----

. Access the discovered service by using the service hostname.
In this example, the hostname is `dbservice.database`.
