= Deploying Submariner

The `submariner-addon` component is a *technology preview* feature.

Complete the following steps to deploy Submariner:

. Log on to your hub cluster with cluster administrator permissions.

. Ensure that you have completed the applicable preparations. See xref:../services/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner] for the requirements.

. Create a `ManagedClusterSet` on the hub cluster by using the instructions provided in link:../clusters/custom_resource.adoc#managedclustersets[ManagedClusterSets]. The `submariner-addon` creates a namespace called `submariner-clusterset-<clusterset-name>-broker` and deploys the Submariner Broker to it. The name of the ManagedClusterSet replaces <clusterset-name> in the namespace name. Your entry for the `ManagedClusterSet` should resemble the following content:
+ 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <ManagedClusterSet-name>
----
Replace _ManagedClusterSet-name_ with a name for the `ManagedClusterSet` that you are creating.

. Enable Submariner to provide communication between managed clusters by entering the following command:
+
---- 
oc label managedclusters <managedcluster-name> "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/submariner-agent=true" --overwrite
----
+
Replace `_managedcluster-name_` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to use with Submariner. 

. Add the managed clusters to the `ManagedClusterSet` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc label managedclusters <managedcluster-name> "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<ManagedClusterSet-name>" --overwrite
----
Replace `_managedcluster-name_` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to add to the `ManagedClusterSet`.
Replace `_ManagedClusterSet-name_` with the name of the `ManagedClusterSet` to which you want to add the managed cluster. 

. Repeat those steps for all of the managed clusters that you want to add to the `ManagedClusterSet`.
