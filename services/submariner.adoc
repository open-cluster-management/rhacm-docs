[#submariner]
== Submariner networking service (Technology preview)

The `submariner-addon` component is a *technology preview* feature.

The _Submariner_ service is an open source tool that can be used with {product-title} to provide direct networking between pods across two or more Kubernetes clusters in your environment, either on-premises or in the cloud. For more information about Submariner, see https://submariner.io/[Submariner].

You can enable Submariner on the {ocp-short} clusters that are hosted in the following environments:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure
* IBM Cloud
* Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated
* VMware vSphere


{product-title} provides a Submariner component that you can deploy in your environment by using your hub cluster.

[#submariner-prereq]
== Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites before using Submariner:

* A {product-title-short} hub cluster that is running on {ocp} version 4.6, or later, with Kubernetes version 1.19, or later.
* A credential to access the hub cluster with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* Two or more {ocp-short} managed clusters that are running on {ocp-short} version 4.4, or later, with Kubernetes version 1.17, or later, and are managed by the {product-title-short} hub cluster.
* Pod and Service Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) between the clusters that do not overlap.
* IP connectivity must be configured between the Gateway nodes. When connecting two clusters, at least one of the clusters must have a publicly routable IP address designated to the Gateway node.
* Firewall configuration across all nodes in each of the managed clusters must allow 4800/UDP in both directions. 
* Firewall configuration on the Gateway nodes must allow ingress 8080/TCP so the other nodes in the cluster can access it. 
* Firewall configuration open for 4500/UDP, 500/UDP, and any other ports that are used for IPSec traffic on the gateway nodes.
+
*Note:* This is configured automatically when your clusters are deployed in an AWS or Google Cloud Platform environment, but must be configured manually for clusters on other environments and for the firewalls that protect private clouds.

== Preparing the hosts to deploy Submariner

Before you deploy Submariner with {product-title}, you must prepare the clusters on the hosting environment for the connection. The requirements vary for different hosting environments, so follow the instructions for your hosting environment.

[#preparing-aws]
=== Preparing Amazon Web Services to deploy Submariner

You can use the `SubmarinerConfig` API to configure the AWS cluster to integrate with a Submariner deployment. There are two ways that you configure the {ocp-short} cluster that is hosted on AWS to integrate it with a Submariner deployment, depending on how the cluster was created. The first procedure applies if you created the cluster by using {product-title-short}. The second procedure applies if your cluster was not created by using {product-title-short}. Complete the procedure that applies to your situation to prepare for the connection:

* *Method 1 - Managed cluster was created using {product-title-short}*
+
Using this method, you apply the `SubmarinerConfig` API to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. When you run this procedure and do not specify an IPSec IKE port or IPSec NATT port, the default ports are automatically opened for the communication. The default ports are 500/UDP and 4500/UDP, respectively. 
+
** If you want to use the default ports for `IPSecIKEPort` (port 500/UDP) and `IPSecNATTPort` (port 4500/UDP), enter a command that contains information that is similar to the following example:
+
----

[#preparing-ibm]
=== Preparing IBM Cloud to deploy Submariner

There are two kinds of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS) on IBM Cloud: the classic cluster and the second generation of compute infrastructure in a virtual private cloud (VPC). Submariner cannot run on the classic ROKS cluster since cannot configure the IPSec ports for the classic cluster.

To configure the ROKS clusters on a VPC to use Submariner, complete the steps in the following links:

. Before you create a cluster, specify subnets for pods and services, which avoids overlapping CIDRs with other clusters. Make sure there are no overlapping pods and services CIDRs between clusters if you are using an existing cluster. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics[VPC Subnets] for the procedure. 

. Attach a public gateway to subnets used in the cluster. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_pgw[Public Gateway] for the procedure. 

. Create inbound rules for the default security group of the cluster by completing the steps in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-network-policy#security_groups_ui[Security Group]. Ensure that the firewall allows inbound and outbound traffic on 4500/UDP and 500/UDP ports for Gateway nodes, and allows inbound and outbound UDP/4800 for all the other nodes.

. Label a node that has the public gateway as `submariner.io/gateway=true` in the cluster.

. Refer to https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/calico/[Calico] to configure Calico CNI by creating IPPools in the cluster.

=== Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated to deploy Submariner

Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated supports clusters that were provisioned by AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

[#preparing-osd-aws]
==== Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated to deploy Submariner on AWS

To configure the AWS clusters on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, complete the following steps:

. Submit a https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa[support ticket] to the Red Hat OpenShift Hosted SRE Support team to grant `cluster-admin` group access to the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated cluster. The default access of `dedicated-admin` does not have the permission that is required the create a `MachineSet`.

. After the group is created, add the user name to the `cluster-admin` group that you created by completing the steps in https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/4/administering_a_cluster/cluster-admin-role.html[Granting the cluster-admin role to users] in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated documentation.

. Complete the prerequisites that are listed in the xref:../services/submariner.adoc#preparing-aws[Preparing Amazon Web Services to deploy Submariner].

. Configure the credentials of the user `osdCcsAdmin`, so you can use that as a service account.

. Configure a service account named `osd-ccs-admin` that you can use to manage the deployment.

[#preparing-vm]
=== Preparing to deploy Submariner on VMware vSphere

Submariner uses IP security (IPSec) to establish the secure tunnels between the clusters on the gateway nodes. You can either use the default IPSec ports, or you can specify other IPSec ports that you configured. When you run this procedure without specifying an IPSec IKE port or an IPSec NATT port, the default ports are automatically used for the communication. The default ports are 500/UDP and 4500/UDP, respectively. 

Submariner uses virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN) to encapsulate traffic when it moves from the worker and master nodes to the gateway nodes. The VXLAN port cannot be customized, and is always port 4800/UDP.

The following ports must be opened by your VMWare vSphere administrator before you can enable Submariner:

.VMware vSphere and Submariner ports
|===
| Name | Default value | Customizable 

| IPSec IKE
| 500/UDP
| Yes

| IPSec NATT
| 4500/UDP
| Yes

| VXLAN
| 4800/UDP
| No
|===

To prepare VMware vSphere clusters for deploying Submariner, complete the following steps:

* If you want to use the default ports for `IPSecIKEPort` and `NATTPort`, complete the following steps:
+
. Ensure that the IPSec IKE, IPSec NATT, and VXLAN ports are open.

. Enter a command that contains information that is similar to the following example:
