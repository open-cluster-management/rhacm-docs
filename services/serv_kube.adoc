[#enabling-a-kubernetes-service-for-discovery]
= Enabling a Kubernetes service for discovery

You can configure the {product-title} service registry to discover Kubernetes services that are in different {product-title} managed clusters.

A Kubernetes service exposes a group of pods that are running on a managed cluster.
The {product-title} service discovery function only discovers Kubernetes services that are configured to be discovered.

*Required user type or access level:* Cluster administrator.

== Discover the Kubernetes service

To discover a Kubernetes service on your managed clusters, complete the following steps:

. Annotate the service to enable the service discovery.
+
You must enable the service in the managed cluster to be discovered by adding the following annotation to your service definition for the service that you want to discover:
+
----
mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery
----
+
The following example shows the format for the `dbservice`:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: "{}"
  name: dbservice
  namespace: database
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: http
    nodePort: 8080
    port: 8000
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: dbservice
----
+
NOTE: The Kubernetes service that you want to discover must be either a `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` type.

. By default, the annotated service can be discovered on all managed clusters.
If you want to discover the service on specific managed clusters, add `target-clusters` in the annotation, as shown in the following example:
+
----
mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: '{"target-clusters": ["cluster1", "cluster2"]}'
----

. Access the discovered service by using the following format:
+
----
<service-name>.<service-namespace>.<service-registry-dns-suffix>
----
+
An example of the format is: `dbservice.database.mcm.svc`.
