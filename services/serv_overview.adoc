= Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes services overview

A {product-title} service can be one of the following types: Kubernetes service, Kubernetes ingress, or Istio service.
A {product-title} service runs on a single managed cluster or on multiple managed clusters.
They support Kubernetes services, Kubernetes ingress services, and Istio services.

The following sections provide a summary of the types of services that are available for {product-title}.

[#kubernetes-service]
== Kubernetes service

A _service_ resource is a Kubernetes service resource.
Edit the `metadata` section of your service definition to add the service discovery annotation.
The following example shows a Kubernetes service resource:

// CD: Where will you find the YAML for the service?

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: "{}"
  name: dbservice
  namespace: database
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: http
    nodePort: 8080
    port: 8000
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: dbservice
----

[#ingress-service]
== Ingress service

An _Ingress_ service is a Kubernetes ingress that defines the criteria where the services on the managed cluster can communicate with other managed clusters.
Edit the `metadata` section of your ingress service definition to add the service discovery annotation.
See the following sample of an Ingress service definition:

----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta2
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dbing
  namespace: database
  annotations:
    mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: "{}"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: mydb.database.mcm.svc
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /db
        backend:
        serviceName: dbservice
        servicePort: 8000
----

[#istio-service]
== Istio service

An Istio _service_ is a Kubernetes service resource.
Edit the `metadata` section of your Istio service definition to add the service discovery annotation.
See the following sample gateway service:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    mcm.ibm.com/service-discovery: "{}"
  name: dbservice
  namespace: database
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    nodePort: 8080
    port: 8000
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: dbservice
