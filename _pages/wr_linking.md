# Links in the documentation

Broken links create an inconvenient experience for the reader. It also slows down other developers when they are testing the documentation. As you create customer-facing documentation, it is important to consider the placement and accurancy for links. When writers advise readers to select a link, it can be disruptive and divert the reader away from the task. To keep the customer in mind, consider providing a link at the end of your page to direct the user to the topic they previously read. This is beneficial in case the user wants to return and view more topics.

You must verify that the links are functioning as expected. If there are broken links in your source file, you might receive the following errors:

* 404 Error
* Direct the user to the wrong page or section 
* Error in the Pantheon log
