[#role-policy]
= Role policy

Kubernetes configuration policy controller monitors the status of role policies.
Apply a role policy to set rules and permissions for specific roles in your cluster.
Learn more details about the role policy structure in the following sections.

// current place holder until this info is updated

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata.name
| Required.
The name for identifying the policy resource.

The namespaces within the hub cluster that the policy is applied to.
Enter parameter values for `include`, which are the namespaces you want to apply to the policy to.
The `exclude` parameter specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to apply the policy to.
*Note*: A namespace that is specified in the object template of a policy controller overrides the namespace in the corresponding parent policy.

[#role-policy-sample]
== Role policy sample

Apply a role policy to set rules and permissions for specific roles in your cluster.
For more information on roles, see link:security_intro.md.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control].
Your role policy might resemble the following YAML file:
