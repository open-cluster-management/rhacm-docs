[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

{product-title} supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to {ocp-short}. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/using-rbac.html[{ocp-short} documentation].

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-scoped and some are namespace-scoped. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in {product-title}:

.Role definition table
|===
| Role | Definition

| *cluster-admin*
| A user with cluster-wide binding to the `cluster-admin` role is an {ocp-short} super user, who has all access.

| *open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin*
| A user with cluster-wide binding to the `cluster-manager-admin` role is a {product-title} super user, who has all access.

| *open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (admin)*
| A user with cluster binding to the `managed-cluster-x` role, has administrator access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| *open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (viewer)*
| A user with cluster-wide binding to the `managed-cluster-x` role, has view access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| *open-cluster-management:subscription-admin*
| A user with the `subscription-admin` role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAMLs in the subscribed Git repository. *Note*: When an non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources.

| *admin, edit, view*
| Admin, edit, and view are {ocp-short} default roles. A user with a namespace-scoped binding to these roles has access to `open-cluster-management` resources in a specific namespace, while cluster-wide binding to the same roles gives access to all of the `open-cluster-management` resources cluster-wide.
|===

*Important*: 

* Any user can create projects from {ocp-short}, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace.

* If a user does not have role access to a cluster, the cluster name is not visible. The cluster name is displayed with the following symbol: `-`.

[#rbac-implementation]
== RBAC implementation

RBAC is validated at the API level. When an user attempts an action from the console, the API might be allowed or rejected based on access role permissions. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecycles in the product.

[#cluster-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Cluster lifecycle RBAC

To perform cluster lifecycle operations, users must have access to the `managedcluster` namespace and custom resource. A user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` roles, has `admin` or `view` access to all management clusters and namespaces.

View the following examples:

* To view `managedcluster x` cluster information, the following roles are required:

  ** A cluster-wide binding to the `view` role for `open-cluster-management`.
  ** A namespace binding to the `view` role for namespace "X".

* To perform an upgrade to `managedcluster x`, the following roles are required:

  ** A cluster-wide binding to the `admin` role for `open-cluster-management`.
  ** A namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "X".

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `subscription` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `subscription` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. For more information on managing applications, see link:../manage_applications/managing_subscriptions.adoc#creating-and-managing-subscriptions[Creating and managing subscriptions].

To perform Application lifecycle tasks, users must have access to the namespace where the application is created and the `managedcluster` namespace. For example, the required access to create applications in namespace "N" is a namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

To perform Governance lifecycle operations, users must have access to the namespace where a policy is created, and access to the `managedcluster` namespace. A user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` access, also have write and read access to all policies and all management clusters on the hub cluster.

View the following examples:

* To view policies in namespace "N" the following role is required:

  ** A namespace binding to the `view` role for namespace "X".

* To create a policy in namespace "N" and apply it on `managedcluster x`, the following roles are required:

  ** A namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".
  ** A namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "X".
