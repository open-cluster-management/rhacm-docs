[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to OpenShift Container Platform. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/using-rbac.html[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].

View the following sections for  details of supported RBAC by component.

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-scoped and some are namespace-scoped. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes:

|===
| Role | Definition

| *cluster-admin*
| An user with cluster-wide binding to the `cluster-admin` role is an OpenShift Container Platform super user, who has all access.

| *cluster-manager-admin*
| An user with cluster-wide binding to the `cluster-manager-admin` role is a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes super user, who has all access.

| *open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (admin)*
| An user with cluster binding to the `managed-cluster-x` role, has administrator access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| *open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (viewer)*
| An user with cluster-wide binding to the `managed-cluster-x` role, has view access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| *open-cluster-management:subscription-admin*
| An user with the `subscription-admin` role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAMLs in the subscribed Git repository. *Note*: When an non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources.

| *admin, edit, view*
| Admin, edit, and view are OpenShift Container Platform default roles. An user with a namespace binding has access to open-cluster-management resources in that namespace.  // come back to this An user with a namespace binding or cluster-wide binding to the roles has access to the `open-cluster-management` resources, and to `managedcluster` resource. *Note*: An user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` have write and read access to all policies and all management clusters on the hub cluster.

|===

*Important*: Any user can create projects from OpenShift Container Platform, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace.

[#rbac-implementation]
== RBAC implementation

RBAC is validated at the API level. When an user attempts an action from the console, the API might be allowed or rejected based on access role permissions. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecyles in the product. 

[#cluster-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Cluster lifecycle RBAC

To perform cluster lifecycle operations, users must have access to the `managedcluster` namespace and custom resource. An user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` roles, has `admin` or `view` access to all management clusters and namespaces. 

View the following examples:

* To view `managedcluster x` cluster information, the following roles are required: 

  ** A cluster-wide binding to the `view` role for `open-cluster-management`.  
  ** A namespace binding to the `view` role for namespace "X".

* To perform an upgrade to `managedcluster x`, the following roles are required: 

  ** A cluster-wide binding to the `admin` role for `open-cluster-management`.  
  ** A namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "X".

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

To perform Governance lifecylce operations, users must have access to the namespace where a policy is created, and access to the `managedcluster` namespace. An user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` access, also have write and read access to all policies and all management clusters on the hub cluster.

View the following examples: 

* To view policies in namespace "N" the following role is required: 

  ** A namespace binding to the `view` role for namespace "X".  
  
* To create a policy in namespace "N" and apply it on `managedcluster x`, the following roles are required: 

  ** A namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".  
  ** A namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "X".

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `subscription` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `subscription` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. For more information on managing applications, see link:../manage_applications/managing_subscriptions.adoc[Creating and managing subscriptions].

To perform Application lifecycle tasks, users must have access to the namespace where the application is created and the `managedcluster` namespace. For example, the required access to create policies in namespace "N" is a namespace binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".
