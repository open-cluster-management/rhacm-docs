[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to OpenShift Container Platform. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/using-rbac.html[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].

View the following sections for  details of supported RBAC by component.

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-scoped and some are namespace-scoped. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes:
//should the role names be enclosed with the codeblock tick marks?
|===
| Role | Definition

| cluster-admin
| An user with cluster-wide binding to the cluster-admin role is an OpenShift Container Platform super user, who has all access.

| cluster-manager-admin
| An user with cluster-wide binding to the cluster-manager-admin role is a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes super user, who has all access.

| open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (admin)
| An user with cluster binding to the managed-cluster-x role, has administrator access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (viewer)
| An user with cluster-wide binding to the managed-cluster-x role, has view access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
| An user with the subscription-admin role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAMLs in the subscribed Git repository. *Note*: When an non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources.

| admin, edit, view
| Admin, edit, and view are default roles in the product. An user with a namespace binding or cluster-wide binding to the roles has access to the `open-cluster-management` resources, and to `managedcluster`resource.
|===

Any user can create projects from OpenShift Container Platform, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace. The following RBAC tables only apply if the user has only the given roles.

[#rbac-implementation]
== RBAC implementation

RBAC is implemented as APIs. When an user attempts an action and the `retrieve` API resource succeeds, the console displays the result. The default roles for `managedcluster` resources are admin, edit, and view. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecyles in the product.

[#cluster-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Cluster lifecycle RBAC

To perform cluster lifecycle operations, users must have access to the `managedcluster` namespace and custom resource. An user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` roles, has `admin` or `view` access to all management clusters and namespaces.

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

To perform Governance lifecylce operations, users must have access to the namespace where a policy is created, and access to the `managedcluster` namespace. An user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` access, also have write and read access to all policies and all management clusters on the hub cluster.

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `subscription` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `subscription` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. An user with cluster-wide binding to `admin` or `view` have write and read access to all policies and all management clusters on the hub cluster. For more information on managing applications, see link:../manage_applications/managing_subscriptions.adoc[Creating and managing subscriptions].
