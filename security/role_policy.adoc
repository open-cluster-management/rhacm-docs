[#role-policy]
= Role policy

Kubernetes configuration policy controller monitors the status of role policies.
Define roles in the `object-template` to set rules and permissions for specific roles in your cluster.
Learn more details about the role policy structure in the following sections.

[#role-policy-table]
== Role policy table

|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required.
Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata.name
| Required.
The name for identifying the policy resource.

| metadata.namespaces
| Optional.

| spec.namespace
| Required.
The namespaces within the hub cluster that the policy is applied to.
Enter parameter values for `include`, which are the namespaces you want to apply to the policy to.
The `exclude` parameter specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to apply the policy to.
*Note*: A namespace that is specified in the object template of a policy controller overrides the namespace in the corresponding parent policy.

| remediationAction
| Optional.
Specifies the remediation of your policy.
The parameter values are `enforce` and `inform`.
*Important*: Some policies might not support the enforce feature.

| disabled
| Required.
Set the value to `true` or `false`.
The `disabled` parameter provides the ability to enable and disable your policies.

| spec.complianceType
| Required.
Set the value to `"musthave"`

| spec.object-template
| Optional.
Used to list any other Kubernetes object that must be evaluated or applied to the managed clusters.

[#role-policy-sample]
== Role policy sample

Apply a role policy to set rules and permissions for specific roles in your cluster.
For more information on roles, see xref:../security/security_intro.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control].
Your role policy might resemble the following YAML file:
