[#managing-security-policies]
= Managing security policies

Create a security policy to report and validate your cluster compliance based on your specified security standards, categories, and controls.
To create a policy for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, you must create a YAML file on your managed clusters.

[#creating-a-security-policy]
== Creating a security policy

You can create a security policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.
Cluster administrator access is required.

The following objects are required for your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy:

* _PlacementRule_: Defines a _cluster selector_ where the policy must be deployed.
* _PlacementBinding_: Binds the placement to a PlacementPolicy.

View more descriptions of the policy YAML files in the xref:policy_example.adoc[Policy overview].

[#creating-a-security-policy-from-the-command-line-interface]
=== Creating a security policy from the command line interface

Complete the following steps to create a policy from the command line interface (CLI):

. Create a policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f policy.yaml -n <namespace>
----

. Define the template that the policy uses.
Edit your `.yaml` file by adding a `templates` field to define a template.
Your policy might resemble the following YAML file:
// how is the role policy effected since role-template are removed
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy1
spec:
  remediationAction: "enforce" # or inform
  disabled: false # or true
  namespaces:
    include: ["default"]
    exclude: ["kube*"]
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          namespace: kube-system # will be inferred
          name: operator
        spec:
          remediationAction: "inform"
          object-templates:
            complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means the role must exist and must have the following rules
            apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
            kind: Role
            metadata:
              name: example
            objectDefinition:
              rules:
                - complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means if the role exists the rule is a musthave
                  apiGroups: ["extensions", "apps"]
                  resources: ["deployments"]
                  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete","patch"]
----

. Define a `PlacementRule`.
Be sure to change the `PlacementRule` to specify the clusters where the policies need to be applied, either by `clusterNames`, or `clusterLabels`.
View xref:../manage_applications/managing_placement_rules.adoc[Creating and managing placement rules].
Your `PlacementRule` might resemble the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement1
spec:
  clusterConditions:
  - type: OK
  clusterNames:
  - "cluster1"
  - "cluster2"
  clusterLabels:
    matchLabels:
      cloud: IBM
----

. Define a `PlacementBinding` to bind your policy and your `PlacementRule`.
Your `PlacementBinding` might resemble the following YAML sample:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding1
placementRef:
  name: placement1
  apiGroup: apps.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: PlacementRule
subjects:
- name: policy1
  apiGroup: policy.mcm.ibm.com
  kind: Policy
----

[#viewing-your-security-policy-from-the-cli]
==== Viewing your security policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to view your security policy from the CLI:

. View details for a specific security policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get securityepolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

. View a description of your security policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl describe securitypolicy <name> -n <namespace>

[#creating-a-cluster-security-policy-from-the-console]
=== Creating a cluster security policy from the console

As you create your new policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor.

. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk*.
. To create a policy, click *Create policy*.
. From the _Create policy_ page, enter the appropriate values for the following policy fields:
 ** Name
 ** Specifications
 ** Cluster selector
 ** Enforce (rememdiation action)
 ** Standards
 ** Categories
 ** Controls

+
NOTE: You can copy and paste an existing policy in to the _Policy YAML_.
The values for the parameter fields are automatically entered when you paste your existing policy.
You can search the contents in your policy YAML file with the search feature.
. View the example Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes security policy definition.
Copy and paste the YAML file for your policy.
+
*Important*:

 ** You must define a PlacementPolicy and PlacementBinding to apply your policy to a specific cluster.
Enter a value for the Cluster select field to define a PlacementPolicy and PlacementBinding.
 ** Be sure to add values for the `policy.mcm.ibm.com/controls` and `policy.mcm.ibm.com/standards` to display modal cards of what controls and standards are violated in the _Policy Overview_ section.

+
Your YAML file might resemble the following policy:
