[#bringing-your-own-certificates]
=== Bringing your own certificates

You can monitor your own certificates with the certificate policy controller.
You must complete one of the following requirements to monitor your own certificates:

* Create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
* Add the label `certificate_key_name` into your Kubernetes secret to monitor your certificates.

Create a Kubernetes TLS secret to monitor your own certificates by running the following command:

----
kubectl -n <namespace> create secret tls <secret name> --cert=<path to certificate>/<certificate name> --key=<path to key>/<key name>
----

[#adding-a-label-into-your-kubernetes-secret]
=== Adding a label into your Kubernetes secret

Update the `metadata` parameter in your TLS Secret by adding the `certificate_key_name` label.
Run the following command to add the `certificate_key_name` label:

----
  kubectl label secret my-certificate -n default certificate_key_name=cert
----

Your updated TLS Secret might resemble the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
   apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: my-certificate
     namespace: default
     labels:
       certificate_key_name: cert
   type: Opaque
   data:
     cert: <Certificate Data>
     key: <Private Key Data>
----

NOTE: When you add the label from the console, you must manually add the label into the TLS Secret YAML file.

----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.

 .. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get policy <policy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
