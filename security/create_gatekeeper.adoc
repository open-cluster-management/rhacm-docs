[#gatekeeper-policy-integration]
= Integrating Gatekeeper

Use the gatekeeper operator policy to install the gatekeeper operator and gatekeeper on a managed cluster. You can create and configure a Gatekeeper operator policy to monitor customer resources (CR) that are created in the same namespace it is deployed.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

[#gatekeeper-operator-policy]
== Installing gatekeeper using a gatekeeper operator policy

Use the governance framework to install the gatekeeper operator. Gatekeeper operator is available in the OpenShift Container Platform catalog. See _Adding Operators to a cluster_ in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[OpenShift Container Platform documentation] for more information.

Gatekeeper operator policy is monitored by the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management configuration policy controller, where `enforce` remediation action is supported. Gatekeeper operator policies are created automatically by the controller when set to `enforce`.

Complete the following steps to install the gatekeeper operator policy from the console:

. Log in to your cluster.
. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk*.
. Create a policy by selecting *Create policy*.
. As you complete the form, select *GatekeeperOperator* from the _Specifications_ field. The parameter values for your policy are automatically populated and the policy is set to enforce to install Gatekeeper.

=== Creating a gatekeeper policy

You can create a YAML file for your gatekeeper policy from the command line interface (CLI). The {product-title} configuration policy propagates the gatekeeper policy from the hub cluster to the managed cluster. 

View the following resource component examples that are required to create a gatekeeper policy:
