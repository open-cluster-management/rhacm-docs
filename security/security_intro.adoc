Manage your security and role-based access control (RBAC) of {product-title} components. Govern your cluster with defined policies and processes to identify and minimize risks. Use policies to define rules and set controls.

For more information see, _Understanding authentication_ in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/understanding-authentication.html[Understanding authentication] in the {ocp-short} docuementation.
