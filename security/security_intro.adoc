[#security]
= Security

Manage your security and role-based access control (RBAC) of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes components.
Govern your cluster with defined policies and processes to identify and minimize risks.
Use policies to define rules and set controls.

*Prerequisite*: You must configure authentication service requirements for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to onboard workloads to Identity and Access Management (IAM).
For more information see, _Understanding authentication_ in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/understanding-authentication.html[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].

[#role-based-access-control]
== Role-based access control

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes supports several roles.
Your role determines the actions that you can perform.
Kubernetes offers role-based access control (RBAC) authorization mechanisms, so users of the cluster platform can be grouped into teams and have namespaces dedicated to teams.
For more information about RBAC, see the _RBAC_ overview in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/using-rbac.html[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].

**Note**: Some product resources are cluster-scoped and some are namespace-scoped. Users can create projects from OpenShift Container Platform, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace. The following role-based access control table only applies if the user has only the given roles.
