Manage your security and role-based access control (RBAC) of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes components. Govern your cluster with defined policies and processes to identify and minimize risks. Use policies to define rules and set controls.

*Prerequisite*: You must configure authentication service requirements for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to onboard workloads to Identity and Access Management (IAM).
For more information see, _Understanding authentication_ in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/understanding-authentication.html[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
