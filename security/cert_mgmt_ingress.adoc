[#replacing-the-management-ingress-certificates]
= Replacing the management ingress certificates

You can replace management ingress certificates. 

[#prerequisites-to-replace-management-ingress-certificate]
== Prerequisites to replace management ingress certificate

Prepare and have your `management-ingress` certificates and private keys ready.
If needed, you can generate a TLS certificate by using OpenSSL.
Set the common name parameter,`CN`, on the certificate to `manangement-ingress`.
If you are generating the certificate, include the following settings:

* Include the route name for {product-title} as the domain name in your certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list.
 ** The service name for the management ingress: `management-ingress`.
 ** Include the route name for {product-title}.
+
Recieve the route name by running the following command:
+
----
oc get route -n open-cluster-management
----
+
You might receieve the following response:
+
----
multicloud-console.apps.grchub2.dev08.red-chesterfield.com
----

 ** Add the localhost IP address: `127.0.0.1`.
 ** Add the localhost entry: `localhost`.
 
[#example-configuration-file-for-generating-a-certificate]
=== Example configuration file for generating a certificate

The following example configuration file and OpenSSL commands provide an example for how to generate a TLS certificate by using OpenSSL.
View the following `csr.cnf` configuration file, which defines the configuration settings for generating certificates with OpenSSL.

----
[ req ]               # Main settings
default_bits = 2048       # Default key size in bits.
prompt = no               # Disables prompting for certificate values so the configuration file values are used.
default_md = sha256       # Specifies the digest algorithm.
req_extensions = req_ext  # Specifies the configuration file section that includes any extensions.
distinguished_name = dn   # Specifies the section that includes the distinguished name information.

[ dn ]               # Distinguished name settings
C = US                    # Country
ST = North Carolina             # State or province
L = Raleigh                # Locality
O = Red Hat Open Shift     # Organization
OU = Red Hat Advanced Container Management        # Organizational unit
CN = management-ingress  # Common name.

[ req_ext ]          # Extensions
subjectAltName = @alt_names # Subject alternative names

[ alt_names ]        # Subject alternative names
DNS.1 = multicloud-console.apps.grchub2.dev08.red-chesterfield.com
DNS.2 = multicloud-console.apps.grchub2.dev08.red-chesterfield.com
DNS.3 = localhost
DNS.4 = 127.0.0.1

[ v3_ext ]          # x509v3 extensions
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer:always  # Specifies the public key that corresponds to the private key that is used to sign a certificate.
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE                   # Indicates whether the certificate is a CA certificate during the certificate chain verification process.
#keyUsage=keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment   # Defines the purpose of the key that is contained in the certificate.
extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth                 # Defines the purposes for which the public key can be used.
subjectAltName=@alt_names                   # Identifies the subject alternative names for the identify that is bound to the public key by the CA.
----

*Note:* Be sure to update the SAN labeled, `DNS.2` with the correct hostname for your management ingress.

[#openssl-commands-for-generating-a-certificate]
=== OpenSSL commands for generating a certificate

The following OpenSSL commands are used with the preceding configuration file to generate the required TLS certificate.

. Generate your certificate authority (CA) RSA private key:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
----

. Generate a self-signed CA certificate by using your CA key:
+
----
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -subj "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat OpenShift" -days 400 -out ca.crt
----

. Generate the RSA private key for your certificate:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out ingress.key 4096
----

. Generate the Certificate Signing request (CSR) by using the private key:
+
----
openssl req -new -key ingress.key -out ingress.csr -config csr.cnf
----

. Generate a signed certificate by using your CA certificate and key and CSR:
+
----
openssl x509 -req -in ingress.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out ingress.crt -sha256 -days 300 -extensions v3_ext -extfile csr.cnf
----

. Examine the certificate contents:
+
----
openssl x509  -noout -text -in ./ingress.crt
----

[#replace-the-bring-your-own-byo-ingress-certificate]
== Replace the Bring Your Own (BYO) ingress certificate

Complete the following steps to replace your BYO ingress certificate:

. Create the `byo-ingress-tls` secret by using your certificate and private key. Run the following command:
+
----
kubectl -n open-cluster-management create secret tls byo-ingress-tls-secret --cert ./ingress.crt --key ./ingress.key
----

. Verify that the secret is created in the correct namespace with the following command:
+
----
kubectl get secret -n open-cluster-management | grep -e byo-ingress-tls-secret -e byo-ca-cert
----

. Create a secret containing the CA certificate by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl -n open-cluster-management create secret tls byo-ca-cert --cert ./ca.crt --key ./ca.key
----

. Edit the management ingress deployment and get the name of the deployment with the following commands:
+
----
export MANAGEMENT_INGRESS=`oc get deployment -o custom-columns=:.metadata.name | grep management-ingress`

oc edit deployment $MANAGEMENT_INGRESS -n open-cluster-management
----

 ** Replace the `multicloud-ca-cert` string with `byo-ca-cert`.
 ** Replace the `$MANAGEMENT_INGRESS-tls-secret` string with `byo-ingress-tls-secret`.
 ** Save your deployment and close the editor.
 +
 The management ingress automatically restarts.

. Verify that the current certificate is your certificate, and that all console access and login functionality remain the same.

[#restore-the-default-self-signed-certificate-for-management-ingress]
== Restore the default self-signed certificate for management ingress

. Edit the management ingress deployment. Replace the string `multicloud-ca-cert` with `byo-ca-cert` and get the name of the deployment with the following commands:
+
----
export MANAGEMENT_INGRESS=`oc get deployment -o custom-columns=:.metadata.name | grep management-ingress`

oc edit deployment $MANAGEMENT_INGRESS -n open-cluster-management
----

.. Replace the `byo-ca-cert` string  with `multicloud-ca-cert`.
 .. Replace the `byo-ingress-tls-secret` string with the `$MANAGEMENT_INGRESS-tls-secret`.
 .. Save your deployment and close the editor.
The management ingress automatically restarts.

. After all pods are restarted, navigate to the {product-title} console from your browser.

. Verify that the current certificate is your certificate, and that all console access and login functionality remain the same.

. Delete the Bring Your Own (BYO) ingress secret and ingress CA certificate by running the following commands:
+
----
oc delete secret -n open-cluster-management byo-ingress-tls-secret
oc delete secret -n open-cluster-management byo-ca-cert
----
