[#manage-security-policies]
= Manage security policies

Use the Governance and risk dashboard to create, view, and manage your security policies and policy violations. You can create YAML files for your policies from the CLI and console. 

From the _Policies_ page, you can customize your Summary view by filtering the violations by categories or standards, collapse the summary to see less information, and you can search for policies. You can also filter the violation table view by policies or cluster violations.

The table of policies list the following details of a policy: _Policy name_, _Namespace_, _Remediation_, _Cluster violation_, _Standards_, _Categories_, and _Controls_. You can apply, edit, disable, or remove a policy by selecting the *Options* icon.

When you select a policy in the table list, the following tabs of information are displayed from the console:

- _Details_: Select the _Details_ tab to view Policy details, Placement details, and a table list of _Policy templates.
- _Violations_: Select the _Violations_ tab to view a table list of violations.
- _YAML_ tab: Select the YAML tab to view, and or edit your policy with the editor.
