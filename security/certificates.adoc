[#certificates]
= Certificates

Various certificates are created and used throughout {product-title}.

You can bring your own certificates. 
You must create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
After you create your certificates, you can replace certain certificates that are created by the {product-title-short} installer.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator or team administrator.

*Note:* Replacing certificates is supported only on native {product-title-short} installations.

All certificates required by services that run on {product-title-short} are created during the installation of {product-title-short}.
Certificates are created and managed by the {product-title-short} Certificate manager (`cert-manager`) service. The {product-title-short} Root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is stored within the Kubernetes Secret `multicloud-ca-cert` in the hub cluster namespace.
The certificate can be imported into your client truststores to access {product-title-short} Platform APIs. 

See the following topics to replace certificates:

* xref:../security/cert_root_ca.adoc#replacing-the-root-ca-certificate[Replacing the root CA certificate]
* xref:../security/cert_mgmt_ingress.adoc#replacing-the-management-ingress-certificates[Replacing the management ingress certificates]

[#list-managed-certificates]
== List managed certificates

You can view a list of managed certificates that use `cert-manager` internally by running the following command:

----
oc get certificates.certmanager.k8s.io -n open-cluster-management
----

*Note*: If observability is enabled, there are additional namespaces where certificates are created.


[#refresh-a-managed-certificate]
== Refresh a managed certificate 

You can refresh a managed certificate by running the command in the <<list-managed-certificates,List managed certificates>> section. When you identify the certificate that you need to refresh, delete the secret that is associated with the certificate. For example, you can delete a secret by running the following command:

----
oc delete secret grc-0c925-grc-secrets -n open-cluster-management
----

[#refresh-managed-certificates-ca]
== Refresh managed certificates for {product-title}

You can refresh all managed certificates that are issued by the {product-title-short} CA. During the refresh, the Kubernetes secret that is associated with each `cert-manager` certificate is deleted. The service restarts automatically to use the certificate. Run the following command:

----
oc delete secret -n open-cluster-management $(oc get certificates.certmanager.k8s.io -n open-cluster-management -o wide | grep multicloud-ca-issuer | awk '{print $3}')
----

The {ocp} certificate is not included in the {product-title} management ingress. For more information, see the link:../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#security-known-issues[Security known issues].

[#refresh-internal-certificates]
== Refresh internal certificates

You can refresh internal certificates, which are certificates that are used by {product-short} webhooks and the proxy server. 

Complete the following steps to refresh internal certificates:

. Delete the secret that is associated with the internal certificate by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete secret -n open-cluster-management ocm-webhook-secret
----
+
*Note:* Some services might not have a secret that needs to be deleted.

. Restart the services that are associated with the internal certificate(s) by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n open-cluster-management ocm-webhook-679444669c-5cg76
----
+
*Remember:* There are replicas of many services; each service must be restarted.

View the following table for a summarized list of the pods that contain certificates and whether a secret needs to be deleted prior to restarting the pod:

[#rotating-the-gatekeeper-webhook-certificate]
=== Rotating the gatekeeper webhook certificate

Complete the following steps to rotate the gatekeeper webhook certificate:

. Edit the secret that contains the certificate with the following command: 
+
----
oc edit secret -n openshift-gatekeeper-system gatekeeper-webhook-server-cert
----

. Delete the following content in the `data` section: `ca.crt`, `ca.key`, tls.crt`, and `tls.key`.

. Restart the gatekeeper webhook service by deleting the `gatekeeper-controller-manager` pods with the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n openshift-gatekeeper-system -l control-plane=controller-manager
----

The gatekeeper webhook certificate is rotated. 

[#rotating-the-integrity-shield-webhook-certificate]
=== Rotating the integrity shield webhook certificate (Technology preview)

Complete the following steps to rotate the integrity shield webhook certificate:

. Edit the IntegrityShield custom resource and add the `integrity-shield-operator-system` namespace to the excluded list of namespaces in the `inScopeNamespaceSelector` setting. Run the following command to edit the resource:
+
----
oc edit integrityshield integrity-shield-server -n integrity-shield-operator-system
----

. Delete the secret that contains the integrity shield certificate by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete secret -n integrity-shield-operator-system ishield-server-tls
----

. Delete the operator so that the secret is recreated. Be sure that the operator pod name matches the pod name on your system. Run the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n integrity-shield-operator-system integrity-shield-operator-controller-manager-64549569f8-v4pz6
----

. Delete the integrity shield server pod to begin using the new certificate with the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n integrity-shield-operator-system integrity-shield-server-5fbdfbbbd4-bbfbz
----

[#observability-certificates]
=== Observability certificates

When {product-short} is installed there are additional namespaces where certificates are managed. The `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace and the managed cluster namespaces contain certificates managed by `cert-manager` for the observability service.

Observability certificates are automatically refreshed upon expiration. View the following list to understand the effects when certificates are automatically renewed:

* Components on your hub cluster automatically restart to retrieve the refreshed certificate.

* {product-title-short} sends the refreshed certificates to managed clusters.

* The `metrics-collector` restarts to mount the renewed certificates.
+
*Note:* `metrics-collector` can push metrics to the hub cluster before and after certificates are removed. For more information about refreshing certificates across your clusters, see the <<refresh-internal-certificates,Refresh internal certificates>> section. Be sure to specify the appropriate namespace when you refresh a certificate.

[#channel-certificates]
=== Channel certificates

CA certificates can be associated with Git channel that are a part of the {product-title-short} application management. See link:../manage_applications/configuring_git_channel.adoc#using-custom-CA-certificates-for-secure-HTTPS-connection[Using custom CA certificates for a secure HTTPS connection] for more details.

Helm channels allow you to disable certificate validation. Helm channels where certificate validation is disabled, must be configured in development environments. Disabling certificate validation introduces security risks.

[#managed-cluster-certificates]
=== Managed cluster certificates

Certificates are used to authenticate managed clusters with the hub. Therefore, it is important to be aware of troubleshooting scenarios associated with these certificates. View link:../troubleshooting/trouble_cluster_offline_cert.adoc#troubleshooting-imported-clusters-offline-after-certificate-change[Troubleshooting imported clusters offline after certificate change] for more details.  

The managed cluster certificates are refreshed automatically.

Use the certificate policy controller to create and manage certificate policies on managed clusters. See xref:../security/policy_controllers.adoc#policy-controllers[Policy controllers] to learn more about controllers. Return to the xref:../security/security_intro.adoc#security[Security] page for more information.
