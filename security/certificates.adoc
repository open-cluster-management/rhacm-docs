[#certificates]
= Certificates

Various certificates are created and used throughout {product-title}.

You can bring your own certificates. 
You must create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
After you create your certificates, you can replace certain certificates that are created by the {product-title-short} installer.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator or team administrator.

*Note:* Replacing certificates is supported only on native {product-title-short} installations.

All certificates required by services that run on {product-title-short} are created during the installation of {product-title-short}.
Certificates are created and managed by the {product-title-short} Certificate manager (`cert-manager`) service. The {product-title-short} Root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is stored within the Kubernetes Secret `multicloud-ca-cert` in the hub cluster namespace.
The certificate can be imported into your client truststores to access {product-title-short} Platform APIs. 

See the following topics to replace certificates:

* xref:../security/cert_root_ca.adoc#replacing-the-root-ca-certificate[Replacing the root CA certificate]
* xref:../security/cert_mgmt_ingress.adoc#replacing-the-management-ingress-certificates[Replacing the management ingress certificates]

[#list-certificates]
== List certificates

You can view a list of certificates that use `cert-manager` internally by running the following command:

----
oc get certificates.certmanager.k8s.io -n open-cluster-management
----

*Note*: If observability is enabled, there are additional namespaces where certificates are created.


[#refresh-a-certificate]
== Refresh a certificate 

You can refresh a certificate by running the command in the <<list-certificates>> section. When you identify the certificate that you need to refresh, delete the secret that is associated with the certificate. For example, you can delete a secret by running the following command:

----
oc delete secret grc-0c925-grc-secrets -n open-cluster-management
----

[#refresh-certificates-ca]
== Refresh certificates for {product-title}

You can refresh all certificates that are issued by the {product-title-short} CA. During the refresh, the Kubernetes secret that is associated with each `cert-manager` certificate is deleted. The service restarts automatically to use the certifcate. Run the following command:

----
oc delete secret -n open-cluster-management $(oc get certificates.certmanager.k8s.io -n open-cluster-management -o wide | grep multicloud-ca-issuer | awk '{print $3}')
----


The {ocp} certificate is not included in the {product-title} management ingress. For more information, see the link:../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#security-known-issues[Security known issues]. Use the certificate policy controller to create and manage certificate policies on managed clusters. See xref:../security/policy_controllers.adoc#policy-controllers[Policy controllers] to learn more about controllers.
