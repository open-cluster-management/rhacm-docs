[#certificates]
= Certificates

Various certificates are created and used throughout {product-title}.

You can bring your own certificates. 
You must create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
After you create your certificates, you can replace certain certificates that are created by the {product-title} installer.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator or team administrator.

*Note:* Replacing certificates is supported only on native {product-title} installations.

All certificates required by services that run on {product-title} are created during the installation of {product-title}.
Certificates are created and managed by the {product-title} Certificate manager (`cert-manager`) service. 

See the following topics to replace certificates:

* xref:../security/cert_root_ca.adoc#replacing-the-root-ca-certificate[Replacing the root CA certificate]
* xref:../security/cert_mgmt_ingress.adoc#replacing-the-management-ingress-certificates[Replacing the management ingress certificates]

== Certificates

The {product-title} Root CA Certificate is stored within the Kubernetes Secret `multicloud-ca-cert` in the hub cluster namespace.
The certificate can be imported into your client truststores to access {product-title} Platform APIs.
