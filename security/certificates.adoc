[#certificates]
= Certificates

Various certificates are created and used throughout Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

You can bring your own certificates. 
You must create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
After you create your certificates, you can replace certain certificates that are created by the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installer.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator or team administrator.

NOTE: Replacing certificates is supported only on native Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installations.

All certificates required by services that run on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes are created during the installation of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.
Certificates are created and managed by the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Certificate manager (`cert-manager`) service. 

See the following topics to replace certificates:

* xref:../security/cert_root_ca.adoc#replacing-the-root-ca-certificate[Replacing the root CA certificate]
* xref:../security/cert_mgmt_ingress.adoc#replacing-the-management-ingress-certificates[Replacing the management ingress certificates]

== Certificates

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Root CA Certificate is stored within the Kubernetes Secret `multicloud-ca-cert` in the `open-cluster-management` namespace.
The certificate can be imported into your client truststores to access Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Platform APIs.
