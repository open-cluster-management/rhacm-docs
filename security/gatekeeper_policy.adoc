[#gatekeeper-policy]
= Integrating gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates

Gatekeeper is a validating webhook that enforces CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) based policies that are run with the Open Policy Agent (OPA). You can install Gatekeeper to integrate a gatekeeper policy with {product-title}. Gatekeeper policy can be used to evaluate Kubernetes resource compliance. You can leverage an OPA as the policy engine, and use Rego as the policy language.

The gatekeeper policy is created as a Kubernetes configuration policy. Gatekeeper policies include constraint templates (`ConstraintTemplates`) and constraints, audit templates, and admission templates. For more information, see the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper#gatekeeper[Gatekeeper].

*Prerequisites*: 

* You must install Gatekeeper on your managed cluster to use the gatekeeper policy controller. For more information, see the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper[`open-policy-agent/gatekeeper`] repository.
* Kubernetes version 1.14 or later

{product-title-short} applies the following constraint templates in your {product-title-short} gatekeeper policy:

* `_ConstraintTemplates_` and constraints: Use the `_policy-gatekeeper-k8srequiredlabels_` policy to create a gatekeeper constraint template on the managed cluster.
