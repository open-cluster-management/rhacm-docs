= Governance and risk

Enterprises must meet internal standards for software engineering, secure engineering, resiliency, security, and regulatory compliance for workloads hosted on private, multi and hybrid clouds. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes governance provides an extensible policy framework for enterprises to introduce their own security policies.

[#governance-architecture]
== Governance architecture

Enhance the security for your cluster with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes governance lifecycle. The product governance lifecycle is based on defined policies, processes, and procedures to manage security and compliance from a central interface page. View the following diagram of the governance architecture:

The governance architecture is composed of the following components:

* **Governance and risk dashboard**: Provides a summary of your cloud governance and risk details, which include policy and cluster violations. You can create, view, and manage your security policies from the _Policies_ page.
* **Policy-based governance framework controllers:** Support policy creation and deployment to various managed clusters based on attributes associated with clusters, such as
a geographical region. 
* **Policy controller**: Evaluates one or more policies on the managed cluster against your specified control, and generates Kubernetes events for
violations. Violations are propagated to the hub cluster. Policy controllers that are included in your installation are the following: Kubernetes configuration, Certificate, and IAM. You can also create a custom policy controller.

You can customize your _Summary_ view by filtering the violations by categories or standards.
Collapse the summary to see less information.
You can also search for policies.

*Note*: 

* When a policy is propagated to a managed cluster, the replicated policy is named as `namespaceName.policyName`. When you create a policy, make sure that the length of the `namespaceName.policyName` is less than 63 characters due to the Kubernetes limit for object names.  

* When you search for a policy in the hub cluster, you might also receive the name of the replicated policy on your managed cluster. For example, if you search for `policy-dhaz-cert`, the following policy name from the hub cluster might appear: `default.policy-dhaz-cert`.

You can view a table list of violations.
The following details are provided in the table: description, resources, severity, cluster, standards, controls, categories, and update time.
You can filter the violation table view by policies or cluster violations.
