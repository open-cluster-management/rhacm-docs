[#governance-and-risk]
= Governance and risk

Enterprises must meet internal standards for software engineering, secure engineering, resiliency, security, and regulatory compliance for workloads hosted on private, multi and hybrid clouds. {product-title} governance provides an extensible policy framework for enterprises to introduce their own security policies.

[#governance-architecture]
== Governance architecture

Enhance the security for your cluster with the {product-title} governance lifecycle. The product governance lifecycle is based on defined policies, processes, and procedures to manage security and compliance from a central interface page. View the following diagram of the governance architecture:

image:../images/security-arch.png[Governance architecture diagram]

The governance architecture is composed of the following components:

* *Governance and risk dashboard*: Provides a summary of your cloud governance and risk details, which include policy and cluster violations. 

+ 
You can create, view, and manage your security policies from the _Policies_ page. The following details are provided in the tablelist of violations: description, resources, severity, cluster, standards, controls, categories, and update time. 

+
You can filter the violation table view by policies or cluster violations. Customize your _Summary_ view by filtering the violations by categories or standards, collapse the summary to see less information, and you can search for policies.

+
*Notes:*  

+
** When a policy is propagated to a managed cluster, the replicated policy is named as `namespaceName.policyName`. When you create a policy, make sure that the length of the `namespaceName.policyName` is less than 63 characters due to the Kubernetes limit for object names.  

** When you search for a policy in the hub cluster, you might also receive the name of the replicated policy on your managed cluster. For example, if you search for `policy-dhaz-cert`, the following policy name from the hub cluster might appear: `default.policy-dhaz-cert`.

* *Policy-based governance framework:* Support policy creation and deployment to various managed clusters based on attributes associated with clusters, such as a geographical region. See the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection[`policy-collection` repository] to view examples of the predefined policies, and instructions on deploying policies to your cluster. You can also contribute custom policy controllers and policies.
* *Policy store*: Use Kuberneters ETCD to store policies as CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) objects.
* *Policy controller*: Evaluates one or more policies on the managed cluster against your specified control, and generates Kubernetes events for violations. Violations are propagated to the hub cluster. Policy controllers that are included in your installation are the following: Kubernetes configuration, Certificate, and IAM. You can also create a custom policy controller.
* *Open source community*: {product-title-short} policy framework, policy controllers, and policies are apart of the `open-cluster-management` repository. You can integrate third-party policies with {product-title} to create custom annotations within the policy templates to specify one or more compliance standard, control category, and control.
